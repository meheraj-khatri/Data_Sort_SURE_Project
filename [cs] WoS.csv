   contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on
   LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary
   articles, nearly 80\% of which have been published in the first 8 months
   of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing
   students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing
   attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education
   contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we
   offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing
   educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to
   frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language
   models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy

   of major developmental breakthroughs unfolding soon in those sectors.
   Education is one such area. While there is certainly a possibility for
   hype and unfulfilled promises, the advent of available GAI platforms,
   such as ChatGPT, has caused a surge of scholarly interest in the impact
   of these technologies on CS education. Amid the growing debate, both the
   potential benefits and concerns of GAI in this sector are increasingly
   coming to the fore as people grapple with the tradeoffs associated with
   these technologies when applied in education settings. One can imagine
   the range of conversations around the topic, but that is difficult to

   This experience report presents an assignment within a course on
   professional competencies, including some related to ethics, that
   computing master's students need in their careers. For the assignment,
   student groups discussed the ethical process by Lennerfors et al. by
   analyzing a case: a fictional researcher considers whether to attend the
   real CHI 2024 conference in Hawaii. The tasks were (1) to participate in
   in-class discussions on the case, (2) to use an LLM of their choice as a
   discussion partner for said case, and (3) to document both discussions,
   reflecting on their use of the LLM.
   Students reported positive experiences with the LLM as a way to increase

   Copilot have led to their integration into various educational domains,
   including software development education. Regular use of LLMs in the
   learning process is still not well-researched; thus, this paper intends
   to fill this gap. The paper explores the nuanced impact of informal LLM
   usage on undergraduate students' learning outcomes in software
   development education, focusing on React applications. We carefully
   designed an experiment involving thirty-two participants over ten weeks
   where we examined unrestricted but not specifically encouraged LLM use
   and their correlation with student performance. Our results reveal a
   significant negative correlation between increased LLM reliance for
   critical thinking-intensive tasks such as code generation and debugging
   and lower final grades. Furthermore, a downward trend in final grades is
   observed with increased average LLM use across all tasks. However, the
   correlation between the use of LLMs for seeking additional explanations
   and final grades was not as strong, indicating that LLMs may serve
   better as a supplementary learning tool. These findings highlight the
   importance of balancing LLM integration with the cultivation of

   been much debate around the impacts and implications of these tools on
   education. Currently, extant literature remarks on the affordances,
   challenges, and opportunities of GenAI, but few studies report and
   analyze empirical studies and educational practices coming up by GenAI
   usage in learning settings. Then, in this Scoping Review (ScR) based on
   146 studies retrieved from the databases SCOPUS, Web of Science (WoS),
   and ERIC, we analyzed the implications of integrating GenAI in
   engineering and computing education from K-12 to tertiary levels. We
   adopted an approach starting from the bibliometric features of the
   studies in terms of authors, cites, years, or cluster topics, and
   navigating to the identification of methodologies, strategies, AI
   literacy instruments and guidelines, learning outcomes, and students'

   can indicate to us a roadmap of its potentialities, uses, and risks from
   the standpoint of both teachers and students, and this could help us to
   create more reflexive methodologies that enhance the teaching-learning

   assist students in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of their
   reports. In a semester-long capstone course, 179 students participated
   in 16 real-world software development projects. They submitted weekly
   StandUp Reports with the assistance of an AI-powered Slack, which
   analyzed their initial reports and provided suggestions for enhancing
   them using both GPT-3.5 and the early access GPT-4 API. After each
