This study investigates research trends in generative AI applications through text network and topic modeling analyses. A comprehensive literature review across IEEE Xplore., Scopus., and Web of Science identified 151 studies published between 2023 and 2024. Text network analysis revealed that “AI.,” “student.,” “education.,” “learning.,” and “performance” were the most frequently occurring terms., highlighting key research themes. Ego-network analysis demonstrated strong interconnectivity between educational AI tools and student learning outcomes. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)., four major research topics emerged: educational chatbots (35.1 %)., AI literacy (25.8%)., exam performance (21.8%)., and technology integration (17.2%). Findings indicate a dominant focus on chatbots for student engagement., while ethical concerns and multimodal AI applications remain underexplored. The study underscores the necessity of addressing AI literacy gaps and enhancing interdisciplinary AI integration in educational settings. Despite its potential., generative AI adoption is hindered by privacy risks., uneven technological access., and the lack of standardized policies. Future research should focus on ethical AI frameworks., multimodal AI tools., and long-term learning outcomes. This study provides a data-driven foundation for understanding the evolving role of generative AI in education and its implications for educators., policymakers., and researchers.","","979-8-3315-0699-5","10.1109/ICAISC64594.2025.10959426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10959426","Generative AI;Computer Science Education;AI Literacy;Educational Chatbots;Topic Modeling Analysis","Ethics;Analytical models;Privacy;Generative AI;Computational modeling;Education;Network analyzers;Chatbots;Market research;Computer science education","","","","13","IEEE","21 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a controlled experiment that explores ChatGPT's role in CS1 in a classroom setting. Specifically, we aim to investigate the impact of ChatGPT on student learning outcomes and their behaviors when working on programming assignments. Participants were tasked with creating a UML diagram and subsequently implementing its design through programming, followed by a closed-book post-evaluation and a post-survey. All the participants were required to screen-record the whole process. In total, 56 participants were recruited, with 48 successful screen recordings. Participants in the Experimental Group can access ChatGPT 3.5 and other online resources, such as Google and Stack Overflow when creating the UML diagram and programming; however, participants in the Control Group can access all online resources except for ChatGPT (i.e., the only design variable is the access to ChatGPT). Finally, we measured and analyzed participants' learning outcomes through their UML diagram, programming, and post-evaluation scores. We also analyzed the time participants took to complete the tasks and their interactions with ChatGPT and other resources from the screen recordings. After finishing the tasks, student participants also provided their perceptions of using ChatGPT in CS1 through a post-survey. With rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that (1) using ChatGPT does not present a significant impact on students' learning performance in the CS1 assignment-style tasks; (2) once using ChatGPT, students' tendency to explore other traditional educational resources is largely reduced (though available) and they tend to rely solely on ChatGPT, and this reliance on ChatGPT did not guarantee enhanced learning performance; (3) the majority of students hold neutral views on ChatGPT's role in CS1 programming but most of them raised concerns about its potential ethical issues and inconsistent performance across different tasks. We hope this study can help educators and students better understand the impact of ChatGPT in CS1 and inspire future work to provide proper guidelines for using ChatGPT in introductory programming classes.","2832-7578","979-8-4007-0498-7","10.1145/3639474.3640076","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-2211429); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554703","CS education;CS1;Generative AI;ChatGPT;OOP","Training;Ethics;Generative AI;Unified modeling language;Chatbots;Recording;Computer science education","","8","","39","","19 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a crucial role in advancing technical development throughout many areas. Evidence points toward the likelihood of major developmental breakthroughs unfolding soon in those sectors. Education is one such area. While there is certainly a possibility for hype and unfulfilled promises, the advent of available GAI platforms, such as ChatGPT, has caused a surge of scholarly interest in the impact of these technologies on CS education. Amid the growing debate, both the potential benefits and concerns of GAI in this sector are increasingly coming to the fore as people grapple with the tradeoffs associated with these technologies when applied in education settings. One can imagine the range of conversations around the topic, but that is difficult to use as input for policymakers and administrators without a more concrete understanding. To wit, there remain open questions about which benefits and concerns people tend to focus on when discussing GAI in education. This large-scale qualitative study addresses that gap by exploring the public's perspectives on GAI in CS education. We engage in this work by collecting and analyzing data from social media platforms, specifically Reddit comments. The social media dataset was analyzed using machine learning (ML) techniques to identify topics based on sentiment analysis. The study's objective was to document and characterize the public's perspectives concerning the general characteristics of GAI, its features related to learning, and its usability in educational settings. Through sentiment analysis using Large Language Models (LLM), the study revealed an overall positive public perception toward using generative AI in CS education, with over 57% of comments being favorable, while also identifying prominent topics of interest and concerns, such as the potential benefits of personalized learning support and automated grading, as well as issues like academic dishonesty, perpetuation of biases, over-reliance on AI hindering critical thinking, displacement of human instructors, and the need for updated curricula. The insights gleaned from the analysis will be instrumental in computing educators gaining a more profound comprehension of GAI 'srole in education and the subsequent development of GAI -enriched curricula.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893102","Generative AI;computer science education;social media dataset;sentiment analysis","Computer science;Bridges;Sentiment analysis;Ethics;Social networking (online);Generative AI;Large language models;Education;Problem-solving;Artificial intelligence","","","","25","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Chatbots like ChatGPT released in the past three years have proven capable of a wide variety of tasks within a conversational interaction, including writing code and answering code-related questions. With these recent advances, chatbots have many potential uses in education, including computer science education. However, before these chatbots are used in CS curricula, their capabilities and limitations must be systematically tested and understood. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities and limitations of four known, open-source, code-based chatbots in programming tasks by performing a standardized study in which different chatbots are tasked with providing answers for a variety of assignments from Boise State University's computer science program. We found that while all of the chatbots can write code and provide explanations, some do better than others, and each of them work differently in conversations. Moreover, all of them suffered similar and important limitations, which has implications for adoption in curriculum. As a second experiment, we used the Llama chatbot to perform a human evaluation by enabling student novice and experienced programmers to use it as a coding assistant to complete specific tasks in a common software development environment. We found that the coding assistant can help novice programmers accomplish simple tasks in comparable time and code efficacy as more experienced programmers. Given these experiments, and given feedback from participants in our studies, we see a clear picture emerge: new programmers should learn important concepts about programming without the help of code assistants so students can (1) demonstrate their understanding of important concepts and (2) have enough experience to assess code assistant output as useful or erroneous. Then, once intermediate skills are mastered (e.g., object oriented programming and data structures), it seems appropriate to introduce students systematically to coding assistants to help with specific assignments throughout the undergraduate computer science curriculum. We conclude by addressing ethical considerations for the use of code-based chatbots in computer science education and future directions of research.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893165","chatbot;large language models;code copilot","Codes;Systematics;Object oriented modeling;Computational modeling;Writing;Chatbots;Encoding;Computer science education;Programming profession;Software development management","","","","29","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this is to prevent hallucinations and to enforce the use of the technical terms and phrases from the lecture. In an exercise platform developed to solve programming problems for an introductory programming lecture, students can request feedback on their solutions generated by GPT-4. For this task GPT-4 receives the students' code solution, the compiler output, the result of unit tests and the relevant passages from the lecture notes available through the use of RAG as additional context. The feedback generated by GPT-4 should guide students to solve problems independently and link to the lecture content, using the time stamps of the transcript as meta-information. In this way, the corresponding lecture videos can be viewed immediately at the corresponding positions. For the evaluation, students worked with the tool in a workshop and decided for each feedback whether it should be extended by RAG or not. First results based on a questionnaire and the collected usage data show that the use of RAG can improve feedback generation and is preferred by students in some situations.

While current engineering education literature has predominantly emphasized the rapid evolution of LLMs as conversational AI tutors for programming languages, the exploration into their effectiveness within general STEM topics remains comparatively scarce. This WIP study thus centers on evaluating the potential of LLMs to facilitate understanding of core hardware design concepts critical to computer science and engineering (CSE) education. By cross-checking the responses from generative AI chatbots to an openended CSE-based question, we aimed to uncover how LLMs, such as ChatGPT-3.5, Claude, Gemini, and Meta AI, can contribute to teaching and learning of general CSE courses instead of a specifically coding-based one. Our method involved simulating a student query on the popular debate between CISC vs. RISC related to computer architecture and analyzing the chatbots' responses. This initial collection of data served as the foundation for a continual comparative analysis aimed at determining the inherent instructional value of each LLM and its validity and reliability. To systematically assess the responses, we introduced an evaluation framework focusing on metrics, such as response accuracy, persuasiveness, and depth of explanation. The current work anticipates not only enriching our understanding of how these advanced LLMs can support general CSE education but also identifying areas where further development is needed for a more holistic integration of LLM-based chatbots in assisting student comprehension in the overarching engineering education.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893528","Large Language Models (LLMs);computer engineering education;AI tutors;CISC;RISC;computer architecture;Instruction set architecture","Computer science;Measurement;Reduced instruction set computing;Large language models;Computer architecture;Chatbots;Hardware;Reliability;Engineering education;STEM","","","","28","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a software engineering student, the use cases for ChatGPT are manifold: assessment preparation, translation, and creation of specified source code, to name a few. It can even handle more complex aspects of scientific writing, such as summarizing literature and paraphrasing text. Hence, this position paper addresses the need for discussion of potential approaches for integrating ChatGPT into higher education. Therefore, we focus on articles that address the effects of ChatGPT on higher education in the areas of software engineering and scientific writing. As ChatGPT was only recently released, there have been no peer-reviewed articles on the subject. Thus, we performed a structured grey literature review using Google Scholar to identify preprints of primary studies. In total, five out of 55 preprints are used for our analysis. Furthermore, we held informal discussions and talks with other lecturers and researchers and took into account the authors’ test results from using ChatGPT. We present five challenges and three opportunities for the higher education context that emerge from the release of ChatGPT.

In particular, we describe how ChatGPT was used in two computing-based courses: a Junior-level course in database systems and a Senior-level class in mobile application development. We identify four evidence-based learning strategies: well-defined learning goals, authentic learning experiences, structured learning progression, and strategic assessment. We align these strategies with the two aforementioned courses and evaluate the usefulness of ChatGPT specifically in achieving the learning goals. Combining Generative AI with evidence-based learning has the potential to transform modern education into a more personalized learning experience.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342970","Generative AI;Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd);pedagogy","Computer science;Transforms;Chatbots;Mobile communication;Database systems;Artificial intelligence;Engineering education","","7","","21","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we experimented with three prominent LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard - to solve real-world OOP exercises used in educational settings, subsequently validating their solutions using an Automatic Assessment Tool (AAT). The findings revealed that while the models frequently achieved mostly working solutions to the exercises, they often overlooked the best practices of OOP.

LLMs have emerged as powerful tools in Computer Science Education (CSEd), offering unparalleled opportunities for enhancing student comprehension and engagement. However, their use in educational settings presents challenges, including tendencies toward hallucination, contextual inaccuracies, and the risk of undermining critical thinking by providing explicit solutions. To address these challenges, and to explore how specialized LLMs can bolster learner engagement, we present Gurukul, a platform featuring dual innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Guardrails. Gurukul offers a hands-on practice feature where students can solve DSA problems within a code editor, supported by a dynamically Guardrailed LLM that prevents the delivery of explicit solutions. Additionally, the platform's study feature utilizes RAG, drawing from OpenDSA as a trusted source, to ensure accurate and contextually relevant information is provided. To assess the platform's effectiveness, we conducted a User Study with students, and a User Expert Review with faculty from a U.S. public state university specializing in DSA courses. Our analysis of student usage patterns and perceptions, along with insights from instructors, reveal that Gurukul positively impacted student engagement and learning in DSA, demonstrating the potential of specialized LLMs to enhance educational outcomes in this field.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893211","Large Language Models;Retrieval Augmented Generation;Guardrails;Computer Science Education;ChatGPT;AI in Education","Technological innovation;Codes;Reviews;Large language models;Retrieval augmented generation;Education;Data structures;Encoding;Data models;Computer science education","","","","38","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the current literature, custom tools, test scripts were developed and, in most cases, manual effort to go through the individual codes were required to identify and categorize the errors latent within the students' code submissions. This entails investment of substantial effort and time from the instructors. In this study, we thus propose the use of ChatGPT in identifying and categorizing the errors. Using prompts that were seeded only with the student's code and the model code solution for questions from two lab tests, we were able to leverage on ChatGPT's natural language processing and knowledge representation capabilities to automatically collate frequencies of occurrence of the errors by error types. We then clustered the generated error descriptions for further insights into the misconceptions of the students. The results showed that although ChatGPT was not able to identify the errors perfectly, the achieved accuracy of 93.3% is sufficiently high for instructors to have an aggregated picture of the common errors of their students. To conclude, we have proposed a method for instructors to automatically collate the errors latent within the students' code submissions using ChatGPT.

As tools like ChatGPT become common in education, we must understand how to incorporate them into our teaching and guide students on their proper use. Although the existing literature focuses on understanding what students use generative AI tools for, less work has been done to examine students' prompting strategies when engaging with these systems. We leveraged a new brainstorming assignment in a first-year engineering course at a large Midwest public university, where students ideated collaboratively using ChatGPT for the design of their term project - a semiautonomous robot (n = 97 teams, 589 prompts). Most prompts (~50%) ranged between 55 and 95 characters, or approximately 8 to 19 words. Our initial qualitative findings suggest that their approaches center on seeking information, much like how they would use a search engine.

Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. This article addresses this gap systematically and details how different LLM-based coding chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. To achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. These objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. These limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness.

The study, initiated in the summer of 2023, focused on assessing ChatGPT's capabilities in generating accurate and complete computer code, identifying and rectifying code defects (bugs), and its scalability in handling larger programs. To achieve this, we conducted a series of experiments with ChatGPT. In one experiment, we introduced bugs into small programs from introductory CSSE courses. ChatGPT was tasked with detecting these defects and providing recommendations for fixing them. We evaluated ChatGPT's effectiveness in bug detection, the quality of its recommendations, and the completeness of the proposed solutions. We sought answers to questions such as whether ChatGPT found all injected defects, provided appropriate recommendations, and delivered high-quality solutions based on criteria like code completeness, size, complexity, and readability. In another experiment, ChatGPT was asked to generate code for assignments from previous CSSE courses, including Intro to Computer Science and Programming in C++, Intro to Python Programming, and Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures using Java. We assessed the generated code's correctness and quality in comparison to student-written code. Similarly, in a third experiment, we evaluated ChatGPT's ability to generate larger programs using requirement specifications from an upper-division CSSE course on Agile Software Engineering. Analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data from these experiments during the summer, we determined that ChatGPT showed promise as an educational tool. Consequently, we developed a plan to integrate ChatGPT into select CSSE courses for the fall semester of 2023. Specifically, ChatGPT was integrated into two of our introductory CSSE courses enabling students to utilize it for debugging assignments and generating practice questions for exam preparation. In addition, we encouraged student teams in our EPICS (Engineering Projects In Community Service) course to utilize ChatGPT as a supplementary aid to help them find and learn any new programming languages or technologies needed for their projects. Anonymous surveys were conducted at the beginning and at the end of these courses to collect feedback from students regarding their experiences with ChatGPT. Initial responses indicated that students were generally familiar with ChatGPT and expressed curiosity about its potential utility, although some skepticism was present. However, by the semester's end, students demonstrated a positive shift in perceptions. They appreciated ChatGPT's assistance in rectifying code bugs, especially after-hours. Additionally, students valued ChatGPT for generating practice questions for exams, despite some inconsistencies in its responses. In our EPICS course, students felt ChatGPT was useful for learning new technologies, though opinions varied on its project management benefits. Lastly, the majority of students felt that ChatGPT helped them adjust to their work progress, showing its potential utility in keeping pace with ongoing projects. Based on student feedback, we propose integrating ChatGPT into future CSSE courses. Finally, as AI -based tools become more integral to academic settings, we believe that disseminating our experiences could potentially enhance engineering and computing education.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10892934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10892934","AI;GenAl;Chatbot;ChatGPT;Software Engineering;Computer Science Education;EPICS","Surveys;Codes;Scalability;Computer bugs;Project management;Chatbots;Object oriented programming;Programming profession;Software engineering;Python","","1","","28","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An increased understanding of students' use is mandatory for educators and higher education institutions, as GenAI is here to stay, and its performance is likely to improve rapidly in the near future. Learning about students' use patterns is not only crucial to support their learning, but to develop adequate forms of instruction and assessment. With the rapid advancement of AI, its broad availability, and ubiquitous presence in educational environments, elaborating how AI can enhance learning experiences, especially in courses such as introductory programming is important. To date, most studies have focused on the educator's perspective on GenAI, its performance, characteristics, and limitations. However, the student perspective, and how they actually use GenAI tools in course contexts, has not been subject to a great number of studies. Therefore, this study is guided by the following research questions: (1) What do students report on their use pattern of ChatGPT in the context of introductory programming exercises? and (2) How do students perceive ChatGPT in the context of introductory programming exercises? To address these questions, computing students at a large German university were asked to solve programming tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT as part of their introductory programming course. Students (n=298) provided information regarding the use of ChatGPT, and their evaluation of the tool via an online survey. This research provides a comprehensive evaluation of ChatGPT-3.5's application by novice programmers in a higher education context. The findings reveal that while students widely adopt GenAI, their use varies significantly, ranging from acceptance of generated solutions to dynamic, and critical engagement.

Additionally, the proposed system includes task creation that adapts to the student's previous performance and completed tasks, ensuring continuous and appropriately challenging learning experiences. The goal of our research is to design a support system that leverages LLM technology to improve children and young students' learning in Python Turtle graphics. This system promises personalized educational support and adaptive task generation, enhancing the overall learning experience for young programmers. Future studies are necessary to test this system with real users, evaluate its effectiveness, and refine its design based on practical feedback.","","979-8-3503-6597-9","10.1109/iSTEM-Ed62750.2024.10663193","Ritsumeikan University's Individual Research Allowance; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10663193","Computer science education;STEM;Human computer interaction","Graphics;Adaptive systems;Education;User interfaces;Encoding;Proposals;Programming profession","","1","","18","IEEE","6 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based upon first observations on the usage of GenAI tools in class, in this paper we suggest and compare concepts for teaching and learning basic software development that integrate GenAI tools at different levels of intensity and at different points during a semester.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), while not a new technology, has seen a rise in popularity over the past two years, with companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft making readily available generative AI tools for anyone to use. This surge in AI popularity has led to a rise in its use in educational settings, in some cases allowed and in others discouraged or disallowed. A debate has risen among academics, particularly in higher education, about what AI's place in education is, with some educators actively encouraging its use while others view the use of AI as a form of academic dishonesty. Given AI is only advancing and is becoming more prevalent, it will only continue to become a more dominant force throughout education and the world at large. This paper presents two educators' distinct viewpoints and experiences on how AI should be handled in computer science courses (absolutely forbidden vs. decriminalized). The goal of this paper is to present different perspectives as well as concrete experiences we have had with AI in our own classrooms to encourage others to consider their own positions on its use and its implications for their own learning environments.

However, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in introductory programming courses raises concerns about AI-assisted cheating. In large-scale settings, faulty code submissions may lead LLMs to overanalyze, causing unnecessary token consumption. This paper proposes a GPT-4o-based code review system that provides accurate feedback while reducing token usage and preventing AI-assisted cheating. Unlike general-purpose LLM tools for professionals, the system is pedagogically designed for primary and secondary students by focusing on review necessity and learner-friendly feedback. The system features a Code Review Module (CRM) that reduces token usage via a Review Necessity Chain (RNC), and Code Correctness Check Module (CCM) combining test case validation with LLM-based assessment. To prevent AI-assisted cheating, the system provides automated feedback on submitted code without prompting and revealing correct answers, which are accessed only through the “Ask Code Tutor” button. In usability test, the system detected up to 42.86% more errors than a conventional online judge. BERTScore analysis showed that over 80% of the system-generated reviews were semantically aligned with human feedback. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art systems demonstrated a blocking success rate of 86%, with a comparable review omission rate. These results indicate that the system provides more accurate feedback than conventional automated code reviews, while achieving token efficiency and supporting self-directed learning through educational feedback.

However, to what extent the use of AI models, such as ChatGPT, is suitable for the creation of didactically and content-wise good exercises for programming courses is not yet known. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the use of AI-generated exercises for beginner and intermediate programming courses in higher education using ChatGPT. We created 12 exercise sheets with ChatGPT for a beginner to intermediate programming course focusing on the objects-first approach. We report our process, prompts, and experience using ChatGPT for this task and outline good practices we identified. The generated exercises are assessed and revised, primarily using ChatGPT, until they met the requirements of the programming course. We assessed the quality of these exercises by using them in our external teaching assignment course at the University of Education Ludwigsburg and let the students evaluate them.

Consequently, it is anticipated to yield greater learning outcomes. However, conventional support systems for learning through quiz creation have demonstrated that the learning outcomes vary depending on the process when learners are responsible for creating the quizzes. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the flexibility of the quiz creation is reduced when the process is streamlined and regulated. To effectively address these issues, we must clarify the quiz creation process to deepen understanding and encourage it in accordance with the process. Moreover, to facilitate the flexible quiz creation and promote a quiz creation process that enhances understanding, we focused on using an interactive generative artificial intelligence (AI). We first analyze the quiz creation process by focusing on three common types: story-based, quiz-based, and solution-based. Additionally, we develop generative AI prompts to facilitate the process. Subsequently, we conducted an experimental application of the generative AI with the designed prompts to university students. The results of the experimental application indicate that the proposed quiz creation process partially contributed to enhancing comprehension through quiz creation, and our approach successfully improved learning outcomes. This study suggests that generative AI can improve learning outcomes by guiding learners to the appropriate process of quiz creation, and that it can help with flexible quiz creation, including the ""natural language expression of a quiz setting"".","","979-8-3503-7623-4","10.1109/TALE62452.2024.10834337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10834337","Quiz creation;Generative AI;Programming education","Generative AI;Natural languages;Education;Focusing;Programming profession","","","","14","IEEE","15 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, few existing works have thoroughly explored the potential of AI in code generation and users’ attitudes toward AI-assisted coding tools. This knowledge gap leaves it unclear how AI is transforming software engineering and programming education. This paper presents a scalable crowdsourcing data-driven framework to investigate the code generation performance of generative large language models from diverse perspectives across multiple social media platforms. Specifically, we utilize ChatGPT, a popular generative large language model, as a representative example to reveal its insights and patterns in code generation. First, we propose a hybrid keyword word expansion method that integrates words suggested by topic modeling and expert knowledge to filter relevant social posts of interest on Twitter and Reddit. Then we collect 316K tweets and 3.2K Reddit posts about ChatGPT’s code generation, spanning from Dec. 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023. Our data analytics show that ChatGPT has been used in more than 10 programming languages, with Python and JavaScript being the two most popular, for a diverse range of tasks such as code debugging, interview preparation, and academic assignment solving. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that fear is the dominant emotion associated with ChatGPT’s code generation, overshadowing emotions of happiness, anger, surprise, and sadness. Furthermore, we construct a ChatGPT prompt and corresponding code dataset by analyzing the screen-shots of ChatGPT code generation shared on social media. This dataset enables us to evaluate the quality of the generated code, and we have released this dataset to the public.

Addressing a gap in current educational technology, this article introduces an AI Knowledge Assistant specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the existing tools by enhancing the quality and relevance of large language models (LLMs). It achieves this through the innovative integration of contextual knowledge from a local “lessons learned” database tailored to the capstone course. We conducted a study with 150 students using the assistant during their capstone course. Integrated into the Kanban project tracking system, the assistant offered recommendations using different strategies: direct searches in the lessons learned database, direct queries to a generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model, query enrichment with lessons learned before submission to GPT and large language model meta AI (LLaMa) models, and query enhancement with Stack Overflow data before GPT processing. Survey results underscored a strong preference among students for direct LLM queries and those enriched with local repository insights, highlighting the assistant's practical value. Furthermore, our linguistic analysis conclusively demonstrated that texts generated by the LLM closely mirrored the linguistic standards and topical relevance of university course requirements. This alignment not only fosters a deeper understanding of course content but also significantly enhances the material's applicability to real-world scenarios.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2024.3396735","National Center for Artificial Intelligence(grant numbers:FB210017); Chilean National Agency for Research and Development; ANID Scholarship Program DOCTORADO NACIONAL(grant numbers:2021-21212115); Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; National Center for Artificial Intelligence(grant numbers:FB210017); Chilean National Agency for Research and Development; ANID Scholarship Program DOCTORADO NACIONAL(grant numbers:2021-21212115); Programa de Inserción Académica 2022, Vicerrectoría Académica y Prorrectoría; ANID Scholarship Program DOCTORADO NACIONAL(grant numbers:2024-21240734); Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data(grant numbers:ICN17_002); ANID Fondecyt(grant numbers:1241462); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10518103","Capstone courses;ChatGPT;context-aware learning;generative artificial intelligence (AI);large language models (LLMs);software engineering education","Software;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Software engineering;Codes;Chatbots;Knowledge engineering","","14","","39","IEEE","3 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study investigates the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4 Turbo, in broadening this scope by autonomously generating Python programming exercises. These exercises are tailored to the CS1 curriculum-an introductory course in computer science. Utilizing curriculum-driven prompt engineering, we developed a dataset of 11,700 exercises, characterized by a variety of cate-gories, types, and difficulty levels. These exercises are distributed across 78 unique topics, which were derived from the CS1 course catalogs of leading universities and supplemented with online educational resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 Turbo in generating CSI Python programming exercises, we conducted a user study involving both students and instruc-tors. The study focused on several metrics: exercise quality, curriculum relevance, understandability, appropriate difficulty level, and the generation of useful hints. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 Turbo can produce high-quality, educationally effective programming exercises at scale, provided that the prompts are systematically crafted. Based on insights from the user study, adjustments to prompt design are recommended to optimize exercise generation. Our research concludes that GPT-4 Turbo can be seamlessly integrated into AI-driven OCPs, offering a scalable, cost and time-effective method to enhance CS edu-cation.

This study investigates the impact of ChatGPT on code quality among part-time undergraduate students in introductory Java programming courses, who lack prior Java experience. The source code of 16 students from the control group (without ChatGPT) and 22 students from the treatment group (with ChatGPT) who completed identical programming exercises focused on coding conventions was analyzed. Static code analysis tools assessed adherence to a common coding convention ruleset and calculated cyclomatic and cognitive complexity metrics. The comparative analysis shows that the ChatGPT-assisted group significantly improved code quality, with fewer rule violations and reduced cyclomatic and cognitive complexities. The treatment group adhered more closely to coding standards and produced less complex code. Violations primarily occurred in line length, final parameters, and the extensibility of object-oriented programming (OOP). These findings suggest that ChatGPT can be beneficial in programming education by helping students write cleaner, less complex code and adhere to coding conventions. However, the study’s limitations, such as the small sample size and novice status of participants, call for further research with larger, more diverse populations and different educational contexts.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3445432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10638538","Programming education;ChatGPT large language models;static code analysis","Codes;Chatbots;Programming;Programming profession;Education;Complexity theory;Java","","5","","36","CCBY","19 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One dimension of teacher preparedness is knowing how GAI is used in classrooms like their own. This paper responds to that need. The paper surveys the literature to answer three questions: in formal instructional interventions, what were the tasks for which GAI was used; what methods did scholars use to evaluate the GAI instructional set; and what were some of the identified challenges and opportunities regarding the use of GAI in ETC classrooms? Taking account of quality and recency of scholarship, and the need to focus on ETC practices, a rapid review of IEEE FIE conference proceedings for 2023 and 2024 was undertaken. Of the 1,181 papers published in both conference proceedings, and after a two-stage screening process, 20 papers were selected for synthesis. Of the 20 papers examined in this review, we found seven patterns of research design. The most common was the learning and teaching intervention followed by gathering student feedback. While we expect that a bigger corpus will yield additional research designs, these seven provide a start for defining a typology of research design investigating student use of GAI. The review revealed eight distinct categories of use ranging from software development, the most common, with over 26 distinct tasks, to data classification and data analysis, each with two distinct tasks. GAI was found to be used for many low-cognitive tasks like generating bibliographies to cognitivelydemanding uses like design and modeling. The studies reported recurring concerns about using GAI, like perpetuating bias, and hallucinations. One striking empirical finding is that previous ways of accomplishing ETC tasks, like using MATLAB and hand analysis, may be quicker and easier than using GAI. The scholarship advocates for broad and deep GAI literacy programs, addressing GAI abilities, limitations, ethics of use, and prompt design. Moreover, instructors are encouraged to be GAI literate themselves. This know-how is central to designing meaningful GAI-based tasks which seek to prepare students for an increasingly AI-infused world and workplace.","2165-9567","979-8-3315-3949-8","10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11016366","engineering education;engineering;technology and computing education;generative AI","Surveys;Hands;Ethics;Reviews;Generative AI;Scholarships;Employment;Engineering education;MATLAB;Software development management","","","","49","IEEE","3 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classic methods, based primarily on similarity, are more and more ineffective against content that is AI-generated, and which resembles authentic student submissions. This requires the use of detection methods that not only establish authorship but also augment student engagement and motivation, thus discouraging future plagiarism attempts. In this work-in-progress paper, we present AVERT (Authorship Verification and Evaluation through Responsive Testing), a proof-of-concept approach for establishing the authorship of programming assignments. Integrated in an LLM-based chatbot, it proactively assesses students' understanding of programming assignments by interactively questioning them about the process of developing their own code. This way the reasons for which students may be dishonest, such as motivation and lack of subject comprehension, are addressed. Using advanced prompting techniques and formulating questions that employ the Socratic method, AVERT dynamically generates questions to verify the students' understanding of the coding process. By asking students to explain the logic behind their solutions, it also improves analytical skills and engages students in the learning process. By automating the assessment of authorship, AVERT alleviates the logistical problems encountered by educators in large classroom environments where individualized assessment demands large resources. It also helps instructors in grading students by making the details of each conversation available for evaluation. AVERT provides a scalable and efficient method for establishing authorship, overcoming the shortcomings of other techniques by directly addressing the primary goal of programming assignments: assessing students' abilities to write functional code.","2473-2060","979-8-3315-1663-5","10.1109/ITHET61869.2024.10837675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10837675","Academic Integrity;Large Language Models;Question Generation;Socratic Method;Computer Science Education;Plagiarism Detection","Training;Codes;Generative AI;Plagiarism;Oral communication;Encoding;Logic;Information technology;Programming profession;Testing","","","","44","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ease of use of ChatGPT may engage students who might otherwise hesitate in asking for support. Before these tools can be meaningfully introduced into a course, work must be done to study the impact of these AI tools on a student's ability to learn. In this study, participants are recruited from introductory Java programming courses at a large public university in the United States. This paper presents preliminary findings from a mixed method study design that consists of a pre-task assessment quiz; and a programming task in one of three conditions: (1) with no external help, (2) with the help of an AI chatbot, or (3) with the help of a generative AI tool like GitHub Copilot; followed by a post-task assessment and an interview on their experience and perceptions of the tools.

In this study, we design a customized role-based agent (CRBA), which can be configured for different roles specializing in specific areas of expertise, making the LLM yield content of higher specialization. An iterative architecture of multi-CRBAs is proposed to generate multistep projects, where CRBAs automatically criticize and optimize the LLM's intermediate outputs to enhance quality. We propose ten evaluation metrics across three aspects to assess project quality through expert grading. Further, we conduct an A/B test among 60 undergraduate students in a programming course and collect their feedback through a questionnaire. According to the students' rating results, the LLM-generated projects have comparable performance to man-made ones in terms of project description, learning step setting, assistance to students, and overall project quality.

This research is grounded in the implementation of ChatGPT in a data analysis course, aiming to evaluate its effectiveness in fostering students' analytical and decision-making capabilities. The study employs a qualitative methodology to assess the educational outcomes of integrating ChatGPT, focusing on its impact on student engagement, learning efficiency, and the development of critical thinking skills in the context of data science. Through a combination of interviews, and analysis of students' project outcomes, we gather insights into the challenges and opportunities presented using genAI in the data science course. A notable innovation of our approach is the introduction of a dual-report assessment method, which not only evaluates the students' project results but also their proficiency in prompt engineering - a crucial skill for effective interaction with genAI tools. Our findings suggest that while students demonstrate enhanced data analysis skills, they also face difficulties in accurately framing queries to yield useful results from genAI, highlighting an essential area for further curriculum development. Further-more, the work delves into the pedagogical strategies that can optimize the benefits of genAI tools in education. It emphasizes the importance of a structured framework that guides students in the ethical use of genAI, encourages critical reflection on AI-generated content, and fosters a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms and their implications for data science. The implications of this research extend beyond the classroom, offering valuable insights for instructors, curriculum developers, and policymakers on integrating AI technologies into educational practices. By providing a comprehensive overview of the benefits and challenges associated with the use of ChatGPT in data science education, this paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue on preparing students for a future where genAI might a significant role.

However, novice program fault localization, which is essential for computer science education, has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies. In contrast to industrial programs target practical functionality, novice programs primarily deal with individual algorithmic issues. The distinct logic structures between novice and industrial programs can impact how effectively LLM understand and process them. Moreover, this difference reveals the inapplicability of the Competent Programmer Hypothesis, a fundamental assumption in industrial fault localization, to novice program fault localization. Therefore, industrial methodologies are unsuitable for novice programming, emphasizing the need for our empirical studies. To fill this gap, we evaluate LLMs’ effectiveness in localizing faults for novice programs in statement level. Using the widely used novice programs dataset Codeflaws and Condefects, we compare the performance of two commercial LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4) and three open-source LLMs (i.e., ChatGLM3, Llama2, and Code Llama) against traditional fault localization methods, examining their accuracy and overlap. Additionally, we investigate how prompt engineering improves localization precision. Our findings show ChatGPT-4’s overall superior performance, with ChatGPT-3.5 exhibiting minor advantages in certain cases. ChatGPT-4 outperforms the traditional methods with best performance by 592% and 137% on Codeflaws and Condefects. Specifically, each method exhibits unique strengths in localizing novice programming faults. Moreover, carefully crafted prompts can improve LLMs’ precision. These insights underscore the promising potential of utilizing LLMs for fault localization in novice programming.","2693-9177","979-8-3503-6563-4","10.1109/QRS62785.2024.00027","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10684637","Large Language Model;Fault Localization;Empirical Study;Novice Programming;Prompt Engineering","Location awareness;Codes;Accuracy;Large language models;Software algorithms;Software quality;Reliability engineering","","1","","65","IEEE","26 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In situations where correct submissions are not available, they resort to using mutation operators, which can lead to a search space explosion problem.

Code reviews are a valuable, but work-intensive, component of the software engineering process and provide important training to undergraduate students in the form of mentor-peer knowledge transfer. Participants in this study engaged in iterative experiential learning using the Automatic Review Tool (ART), an artificial intelligence tool to support software engineering as an Automatic Static Analysis Tool in the Continuous Integration pipeline alongside software testing harnesses and code style checkers. This pilot study was based on earlier results from a full computer science second semester (CS2) class $(\mathrm{n}=74)$ to develop an ART-generated code review intervention pilot study with a small group of students in CS2 / 3 and CS4. The project underway uses an experiential learning and iterative feedback process to answer research questions including “Does ART provide accurate and actionable code reviews for students” and “Which levels of students are best prepared to receive and use ART-based code reviews?” During this pilot study, the project used a mixed methods research approach with a series of surveys, code review interventions, and numerical analysis of the code reviews' accuracy. Results showed a reasonable degree of code review accuracy by ART and the students learned code review skills from interaction with the ART-based reviews they received.

However, functional correctness is not the only metric that evaluates the quality of programs. Runtime efficiency is a metric that is less frequently evaluated in programming courses, yet it holds significant importance in the context of professional software development. To investigate this gap and its potential ramifications, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on the time efficiency of 250 programming assignments that are evaluated solely on functional correctness.

This results in generic MCQs which are not relevant to every course. Template-based methods for generating MCQs require less effort but are similarly limited. At the same time, advances in natural language processing have resulted in large language models (LLMs) that are capable of doing tasks previously reserved for people, such as generating code, code explanations, and programming assignments. In this paper, we investigate whether these generative capabilities of LLMs can be used to craft high-quality M CQs more efficiently, thereby enabling instructors to focus on personalizing MCQs to each course and the associated learning goals. We used two LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, to generate isomorphic MCQs based on MCQs from the Canterbury Question Bank and an Introductory to Low-level C Programming Course. We evaluated the resulting MCQs to assess their ability to generate correct answers based on the question stem, a task that was previously not possible. Finally, we investigate whether there is a correlation between model performance and the discrimination score of the associated MCQ to understand whether low discrimination questions required the model to do more inference and therefore perform poorly.

Through a mixed-methods approach, we examine students' perceptions, engagement, and practical application of the CS50 Duck within our Computational Thinking course. Our results indicate that while proficient students use GenAI tools to reinforce problem-solving skills, struggeling students may over-rely on them, potentially bypassing critical learning processes. Survey and assignment data suggest that students value the non-judgmental feedback provided by the CS50 Duck, yet express nuanced views on GenAI's role in formal assessments and programming education. We show that analysing chat histories can serve as a qualitative framework for examining the interactions between students and artificial tutors, while simultaneously offering critical insights into students' learning processes and the challenges they encounter.

However, the process of manually generating catalogs of code modifications is intricate and time-consuming. This article proposes contextual error model repair (CEMR), an automated program repair tool for introductory programming assignments. CEMR is designed to learn program code modifications from incorrect–correct code pairs automatically. Then, it utilizes these code modifications along with CodeBERT, a generative AI, to repair students' new incorrect programs in the same programming assignment. CEMR builds on the observation that code edits performed by students in pairs of incorrect–correct code can be used as input–output examples for learning code modifications. The key idea of CEMR is to leverage the wisdom of the crowd: it uses the existing code modifications of incorrect–correct student code pairs to repair the new incorrect student attempts. We chose three of the most related APR tools, Refazer, Refactory, and AlphaRepair, as the baselines to compare against CEMR. The experimental results demonstrate that, on public and real classroom datasets, CEMR achieves higher repair rates than the baselines. Through further analysis, CEMR has demonstrated promising effectiveness in addressing semantical and logical errors while its performance in fixing syntactical errors is limited. In terms of time for repairing buggy programs, CEMR costs approximately half as much as AlphaRepair requires. We opine that CEMR not only be seen as a program repair method that achieves good results with incorrect–correct code pairs but also be further utilized to generate hints to better assist students in learning programming.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2024.3403710","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61907002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10535720","Large language model;program repair;programming education","Codes;Maintenance engineering;Programming profession;Context modeling;Syntactics;Computer bugs;Problem-solving","","3","","44","IEEE","21 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We classified these studies into three categories: (1) studies focused on developing or evaluating automated tools and their usage (e.g., code analyzers, tutors, and refactoring tools), (2) studies discussing other instructional materials, such as learning resources (e.g., refactoring lessons and activities), rubrics, and catalogs of violations, and (3) studies discussing how to integrate code structure into the curriculum through a holistic approach to course design to support code quality. While most approaches use analyzers that point students to problems in their code, incorporating these tools into classrooms is not straightforward. Combined with further research on code structure instruction in the classroom, we call for more studies on effectiveness. Over 40% of instructional studies had no evaluation. Many studies show promise for their interventions by demonstrating improvement in student performance (e.g., reduced violations in student code when using the intervention compared with code that was written without access to the intervention). These interventions warrant further investigation on learning, to see how students apply their knowledge after the instructional supports are removed.","2832-7578","979-8-3315-3709-8","10.1109/CSEET66350.2025.00027","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1948519); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11024456","Code Quality;Code Structure;Coding Style","Codes;Generative AI;Education;Buildings;Manuals;Software;Encoding;Object recognition;Systematic literature review","","","","88","IEEE","12 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we proposed two approaches: the plain approach that uses GPT-4o-mini in a vanilla setting, and the augmented approach that integrates additional strategies such as tailored prompts with syntax and semantic constraints, and a feedback mechanism with information on test-effectiveness metrics. We evaluate the two approaches on six real-world programming assignments from an introductory-level programming course at our university. Compared to the plain approach, the augmented approach improves the usability and effectiveness of the generated unit tests, reducing 85 % compilation errors while enhancing the statement coverage and mutation scores by 1.7 x and 2.1 x, respectively. In addition, the augmented approach also complements human-written tests by covering additional program behaviors. In a case study of 1296 students' submissions that pass human-written tests, the augmented approach successfully detected new bugs in 13 % submissions, with an accuracy of 27 %.

LLMs are also applied effectively in debugging assistance to detect and repair syntactic and semantic errors in student code. This review identifies several research directions, including prompt engineering refinement, improved feedback system scalability, and deeper exploration of the long-term educational impacts of LLM. The study concludes that LLMs are effective in enhancing the assessment process, but a balanced approach combining human oversight with automated feedback is crucial to fostering critical thinking and ensuring long-term learning success in programming education.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3584060","Centro de Estudos e Sistemas Avançados do Recife; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11058691","Programming education;assessment processes;large language models;adaptive learning","Education;Programming profession;Maintenance engineering;Debugging;Databases;Codes;Scalability;Real-time systems;Large language models;Accuracy","","","","33","CCBY","30 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Using Chat-GPT to Create Multiple Choice CS Exams","K. Lejmbach; S.

Traditionally, students' understanding of computing concepts are often verified using written exams. This is especially the case in larger universities due to their overall enrollment sizes, making more authentic, involved assignments particularly hard to facilitate. Since the rise of Chat-GPT and other LLMs, the use of such exams has seen a resurgence in popularity in classrooms globally. Fears have recently grown that programming assignments, particularly those that are take home assignments, are not adequate assessments of students' understanding given the ease at which students can use LLMs such as Chat-GPT to obtain answers. multiple-choice exams have been a traditionally popular programming exam format, where-in students are required to choose the correct answer to a prompt or the segment of code that best fits within a larger block of code. Another form of exam question that has been traditionally popular is providing students with blocks of code and ask students to either interpret the code's meaning or find the errors in the code. Both of these styles of assignments provide opportunities for students to demonstrate a deep understanding of code syntax and structure, while also tasking them to demonstrate their understanding of what the intended purpose of the code is. However, the development of these exam problems has traditionally required a substantial amount of work for instructors and teaching assistants to develop. Our goal with this work was to determine if LLMs represent effective tools for developing exam questions. Additionally, we wanted to see if LLMs could effectively design problems based on learning outcomes, allowing the instructor to become the evaluator of the exam questions rather than the original author. Our motivation for this was to develop a reproducible and easier to implement methodology for developing exams at scale for instructors while alleviating the workload imposed on instructors during the development of exams. Our initial research has indicated the use of these LLMs for exam problem generation greatly reduces the workload for instructors while allowing for the creation of far richer programming questions for students that require them to apply more of their knowledge to individual problems. We have had a good amount of success in developing these problems for upper-division courses, as well as introductory-level courses. This work represents initial steps towards the use of these LLMs for generating exams and more work is needed to determine the actual efficacy and long-term benefits and reliability of these tools. Regardless, we are confident that LLMs in their current form represent incredibly powerful tools for instructors to utilize in the development of their course exams.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893096","large language models;exam development;computing education;Chat-GPT","Codes;Large language models;Education;Syntactics;Reliability;Programming profession","","","","7","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research will advance knowledge about artificial intelligence in education. This study explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly learning platforms like ChatGPT, on students' academic experiences, focusing on study habits, academic achievement, social interactions, and emotional growth. By surveying 54 faculty members through a combination of multiple-choice and open-ended questions, the research employs both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the influence of AI in education. The findings reveal a dual-sided impact. While AI enhances academic performance through personalized learning and improved accessibility, it poses significant challenges. Overreliance on AI tools appears to hinder critical facets of student development, including study habits, emotional well-being, social interactions, and critical thinking. The convenience of AI risks fostering passive learning behaviors, reducing interpersonal communication, and promoting emotional and social detachment. This research underscores the need for a balanced approach to AI integration in education. To maximize benefits and mitigate drawbacks, educators and institutions must combine AI's potential with active teacher involvement, emphasizing critical thinking and social engagement.

Automated program repair (APR) techniques have been used to fix the bugs in programming assignments, where the Large Language Models (LLMs) based approaches have shown promising results. Given the growing complexity of identifying and fixing bugs in advanced programming assignments, current fine-tuning strategies for APR are inadequate in guiding the LLM to identify bugs and make accurate edits during the generative repair process. Furthermore, the autoregressive decoding approach employed by the LLM could potentially impede the efficiency of the repair, thereby hindering the ability to provide timely feedback. To tackle these challenges, we propose FastFixer, an efficient and effective approach for programming assignment repair. To assist the LLM in accurately identifying and repairing bugs, we first propose a novel repair-oriented fine-tuning strategy, aiming to enhance the LLM’s attention towards learning how to generate the necessary patch and its associated context. Furthermore, to speed up the patch generation, we propose an inference acceleration approach that is specifically tailored for the program repair task. The evaluation results demonstrate that FastFixer obtains an overall improvement of 20.46% in assignment fixing when compared to the state-of-the-art baseline. Considering the repair efficiency, FastFixer achieves a remarkable inference speedup of 16.67× compared to the autoregressive decoding algorithm.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering; • Computing methodologies → Artificial intelligence;","2643-1572","979-8-4007-1248-7","","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10765070","Automated Program Repair;Large Language Models;Programming Education;Inference Acceleration","Large language models;Computer bugs;Software algorithms;Education;Maintenance engineering;Inference algorithms;Software;Decoding;Programming profession;Software engineering","","","","41","","29 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has necessitated the need to better understand how GenAI is being used by professionals in the field so that we can better prepare students for the workforce. An improved understanding of the use of GenAI in practice can help provide guidance on the design of GenAI literacy efforts including how to integrate it within courses and curriculum, what aspects of GenAI to teach, and even how to teach it. This paper presents a field study that compares the use of GenAI across three different functions - product development, software engineering, and digital content creation - to identify how GenAI is currently being used in the industry. This study takes a human augmentation approach with a focus on human cognition and addresses three research questions: how is GenAI augmenting work practices; what knowledge is important and how are workers learning; and what are the implications for training the future workforce. Findings show a wide variance in the use of GenAI and in the level of computing knowledge of users. In some industries GenAI is being used in a highly technical manner with deployment of fine-tuned models across domains. Whereas in others, only off-the-shelf applications are being used for generating content. This means that the need for what to know about GenAI varies, and so does the background knowledge needed to utilize it. For the purposes of teaching and learning, our findings indicated that different levels of GenAI understanding needs to be integrated into courses. From a faculty perspective, the work has implications for training faculty so that they are aware of the advances and how students are possibly, as early adopters, already using GenAI to augment their learning practices.","2165-9567","979-8-3315-3949-8","10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016386","US NSF(grant numbers:2319137,1954556,1939105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11016386","generative artificial intelligence;engineering education;computing education;AI literacy;workplace studies","Industries;Training;Generative AI;Employment;Learning (artificial intelligence);Intellectual property;Human augmentation;Product development;Engineering education;Software engineering","","","","41","IEEE","3 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To mitigate this, we demonstrate the application of using a large language model (LLM), GPT-3.5, to suggest less complex versions of the user-written Python program, aiming to encourage users to learn how to write better programs. We propose a method to leverage the prompting with few-shot examples of the LLM by selecting the best-suited code refactoring examples for each target programming problem based on the prior evaluation of prompting with the one-shot example.

Although auto-gradable programming exercises address scalability, creating enough high-quality exer-cises-particularly designing comprehensive unit tests-remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we introduce a GPT-based feature that automates unit test generation for customized exercises. With a single button press, instructors can adapt existing exercises to meet specific teaching objectives while preserving auto-gradability. The AI-generated tests comprehensively cover potential edge cases that might otherwise be overlooked, thus reducing the need for manual oversight. An empirical evaluation with eight experienced educators showed these tests to be both thorough and time-efficient, achieving an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 81.79. Participants, who reported intermediate to advanced proficiency in designing manual unit tests and intermediate familiarity with AI tools like ChatGPT, praised the feature's ease of use and seamless workflow integration. Their combined expertise in teaching, coding, and AI-informed course development allowed them to provide insightful feedback on the practicality and reliability of our GPT-based solution. Our study includes a small participant pool ($\mathrm{n}=8$) and primarily focuses on Python, a language wellsupported by GPT. Future research will involve expanding the participant group, exploring additional programming languages, and assessing long-term tool performance and adaptability in diverse educational contexts. By harnessing GPT's language modeling capabilities, our approach addresses the gap between generic, limited-coverage test generation and the need for robust, domain-specific tests. Early reports from participants suggest that specialized exercises-such as those involving advanced data structures-can also benefit from automated unit test generation, though further evaluation is necessary. By leveraging artificial intelligence, this method streamlines exercise customization and enhances the overall usability and effectiveness of programming education tools. It has the potential to revolutionize auto-gradable exercise creation at scale, empowering educators to deliver high-quality instruction while tackling both the technical and pedagogical challenges in programming education.","2165-9567","979-8-3315-3949-8","10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11016616","Unit testing;Programming Education;GPT-4omini;System Usability","Technological innovation;Codes;Education;User centered design;Manuals;Test pattern generators;Artificial intelligence;Usability;Programming profession;Testing","","","","51","IEEE","3 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the IT sector showed resilience amid these challenges, highlighting its potential to drive economic growth. Despite this potential, Sri Lanka has struggled to capitalize fully on global demand for IT services due to a skills gap among Sri Lankan youth compared to their Indian counterparts. India's IT outsourcing industry has thrived partly because of the early involvement of young professionals in open-source projects such as the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), Linux Kernel and React. This trend underscores the importance of foundational programming education to develop competitive technical skills from a young age. To address this gap, authors developed a mobile learning solution CodeSafari, designed to introduce core programming concepts data types, conditional statements, and loops to young Sri Lankan learners. The platform uses Personalized Storytelling and a Customized Kids Assisting System in students' native language, making programming more accessible. Programming training with the app improved test scores for 58 percent of participants.

In recent years, model-based approaches utilizing abstract syntax trees (ASTs) have been widely applied to code classification tasks. Many of these methods start by parsing source code into abstract syntax trees, followed by encoding them as sequences for input into temporal models or Transformer models for subsequent processing. However, existing methods suffer from issues such as loss of structural information and slow training speeds. In response to these challenges, we introduce an approach named the Sparse Attention-based neural network for Code Classification (SACC) in this paper. The approach involves two main steps: In the first step, source code undergoes syntax parsing and preprocessing. The generated abstract syntax tree is split into sequences of subtrees and then encoded using a recursive neural network to obtain a high-dimensional representation. This step simultaneously considers both the logical structure and lexical level information contained within the code. In the second step, the encoded sequences of subtrees are fed into a Transformer model that incorporates sparse attention mechanisms for the purpose of classification. This method efficiently reduces the computational cost of the self-attention mechanisms, thus improving the training speed while preserving effectiveness. Our work introduces a carefully designed sparse attention pattern that is specifically designed to meet the unique needs of code classification tasks. This design helps reduce the influence of redundant information and enhances the overall performance of the model. Finally, we also deal with problems in previous related research, which include issues like incomplete classification labels and a small dataset size. We annotated the CodeNet dataset with algorithm-related labeling categories, which contains a significantly large amount of data. Extensive comparative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SACC for the code classification tasks.","","979-8-3503-3138-7","10.1109/DSInS60115.2023.10455451","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10455451","code classification;code representation;abstract syntax tree;sparse attention","Training;Codes;Source coding;Neural networks;Text categorization;Syntactics;Transformers","","1","","48","IEEE","11 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Achieving effective individualization relies on dynamic adaptation of the learning path, typically facilitated by recommender systems. These systems offer personalized suggestions, commonly employing content-based or collaborative filtering approaches. However, traditional recommender systems often lack consideration of the semantics of learning elements. To address this limitation, ontology-based recommender systems integrate semantic modeling, establishing additional connections within a domain to enhance precision and context in recommendations. Notably, these systems mitigate the cold start problem and are particularly advantageous in learning environments with limited data. While videos are prevalent in learning platforms, their unstructured nature poses challenges for processing. This paper introduces an innovative approach, leveraging Large Language Models, specifically GPT, to extract metadata from learning videos. The proposed method intelligently augments videos and links them to a domain ontology, enabling the integration of videos into ontology-based recommender systems. The application of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in software engineering education, showcasing its potential to enhance individualized learning experiences in specific domains.

With the emergence of agile software development, generating comprehensive user stories that capture all necessary functionalities and perspectives has become crucial for software development. Every computing program in the United States requires a semester-or year-long senior capstone project, which requires student teams to gather and document technical requirements. Effective user story generation is crucial for successfully implementing software projects. However, user stories written in natural language can be prone to inherent defects such as incompleteness and incorrectness, which may creep in during the downstream development activities like software designs, construction, and testing. One of the challenges faced by software engineering educators is to teach students how to elicit and document requirements, which serve as a blueprint for software development. Advanced AI technologies have increased the popularity of large language models (LLMs) trained on large multimodal datasets. Therefore, utilizing LLM-based techniques can assist educators in helping students discover aspects of user stories that may have been overlooked or missed during the manual analysis of requirements from various stakeholders. The main goal of this research study is to investigate the potential application of OpenAI techniques in software development courses at two academic institutions to enhance software design and development processes, aiming to improve innovation and efficiency in team project-based educational settings. The data used for the study constitute student teams generating user stories by traditional methods (control) vs. student teams using OpenAI agents (treatment) such as gpt-4-turbo for generating user stories. The overarching research questions include: RQ-l) What aspects of user stories generated using OpenAI prompt engineering differ significantly from those generated using the traditional method? RQ-2) Can the prompt engineering data provide insights into the efficacy of the questions/prompts that affect the quality and comprehensiveness of user stories created by software development teams? Industry experts evaluated the user stories created and analyzed how prompt engineering affects the overall effectiveness and innovation of user story creation, which provided guidelines for incorporating AI-driven approaches into software development practices. Overall, this research seeks to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the application of AI in software engineering education, specifically in user story generation. Investigating the use of AI technologies in user story generation could further enhance the usability of prompt engineering in agile software development environments. We plan to expand the study to investigate the long-term effects of prompt engineering on all phases of software development.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893343","Collaboration network;complex network analysis;structured collaboration network","Technical requirements;Technological innovation;Agile software development;Collaboration;Software;Prompt engineering;Stakeholders;Usability;Software engineering;Testing","","","","31","USGov","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These errors can lead to unexpected behaviors in programming. Understanding, finding, and effectively dealing with errors is an integral part of programming learning as well as software development. To classify the errors, we propose a multi-label error classification of source code for dealing with programming data by using the ML-KNN classifier with CodeT5 embeddings. In addition, several deep neural network (DNN) models, including GRU, LSTM, BiLSTM, and BiLSTM-A (attention mechanism) are also employed as baseline models to classify the errors. We trained all the models by using a large-scale dataset (original error labels) as well as modified datasets (summarized error labels) of the source code. The average classification accuracy of the proposed model is 95.91% and 84.77% for the original and summarized error-labeled datasets, respectively. The exact match accuracy is 22.57% and 27.22% respectively for the original and summarized error-labeled datasets.

Automation has allowed developers to be more productive and deliver superior results. However, automation is not as widespread in software engineering education. To improve educational outcomes and provide more effective feedback to students, this research implements software engineering methods and automation techniques in software engineering education and evaluates their effectiveness. Our focus is on establishing a connection between source code and natural language, allowing us to generate a natural language description from a given source code sample. To generate feedback, we employ deep learning models to learn code representations and gain a deeper understanding of code. However, the complexity of code makes it challenging to learn its representation accurately. After learning about code, we compare students' code with the instructor-provided solution based on configurable thresholds and generate comments to provide guidance. This work extends the Transformer model, GraphCodeBERT, which is a pre-trained model for programming languages that incorporates the inherent structure of code. We utilize both syntax-level information, such as abstract syntax trees, and semantic-level information, such as data flow, during pre-training. The data flow graph has nodes representing variables and edges indicating the “where-the-value-comes-from” relationship between variables. Our model is based on the Transformer neural architecture and uses a gated graph neural network model to learn code embeddings. This function incorporates code structure, a copy mechanism, and relative position representations, allowing the model to better understand the semantics of code.

URM students interested in pursuing STEM show increased engagement and confidence from more holistic outreach programs, however there is a dearth of instructors who represent URM student identities who also have the necessary technical know-how. However, new AI tools based on Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5, have been shown to increase the productivity of software developers, with the largest productivity gains being for non-experts. Therefore, we propose a study on the usability of LLMs as an educational tool for supporting instructors of various skill levels in both facilitating and scaling programming classes for URM students. We aim to evaluate the capacity for these AI tools to help reduce the digital divide by exploring the limitations, effectiveness, and potential hesitations URM communities may have with integrating LLMs into their classrooms. If LLMs can support, and/or help scale the number of, culturally responsive mentors capable of instructing programming courses, URM students in the US may be poised as one of the major beneficiaries of these new AI tools.","","979-8-3503-7291-5","10.1109/BICE60192.2024.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10605878","STEM Education;Artificial Intelligence;Accessibility;Technology Literacy","","","1","","0","IEEE","25 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
