   Specifically, while it improves prospects in many areas (i.e. remote
   learning, asynchronous communication, online collaboration,
   gamification, student engagement and assessments), it also poses
   significant challenges, particularly in relation to academic integrity
   and traditional forms of assessment (i.e. `open book', non-invigilated,
   essays). Drawing on insights from social epistemology, I argue that this
   exogenous shock to the educational system provides opportunities for
   epistemic evolution, particularly in fields like management education,
   where essays have traditionally been the dominant form of assessment. I
   conclude by proposing potential responses to this disruption that can
   enable educators, students and institutions to succeed in this new
   environment.",10.1177/13505076231217667,
"Can AI replace humans? Comparing the capabilities of AI tools and human
   performance in a business management education scenario","Herath, Dinuka B. and Ode, Egena and Herath, Gayanga B.",BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL,2025,"This study provides a comparative assessment of the capabilities of
   leading artificial intelligence (AI) tools and human participants in a
   business management education context. Specifically, we (a) assess how
   well current language models perform in providing answers to
   standardised essay-type assessments in a business and management
   education context, (b) examine the efficacy of emergent tools in
   detecting AI-generated texts and (c) evaluate online AI rewriting and
   paraphrasing tools and their efficacy in evading detection. Using an
   exploratory qualitative design, this study generated and evaluated 15
   standard essays using ChatGPT (n = 5), Bard (n = 5) and human (n = 5). A
   comparison is provided between the average performance of AI-derived
   essays and that of ChatGPT-generated essays across all five essays. The
   results suggest that AI-generated content can achieve reasonably high
   marks in management and business assessments. According to the findings
   of the study, AI's performance is highly influenced by the types of
   prompts used, the user's experience and the degree to which the user can
   discern between relevant and irrelevant content. According to the
   findings, Turnitin's AI detection tool is highly effective at detecting
   content that has been created by AI, but the effectiveness is reduced by
   rewriters. The Turnitin AI detection tool, however, is significantly
   more effective at identifying content generated by Bard compared with
   content generated by ChatGPT. According to the results, ChatGPT produced
   better results when the user provided a clear context, outlined the
   topic and expectations, divided the assessment tasks into sections and
   fed the prompts in a conversational manner to train the model. By
   utilising AI chatbots effectively, traditional teaching and assessment
   methods can be supplemented with targeted and engaging learning
   experiences.",10.1002/berj.4111,
ChatGPT's Role in Gerontology Research,"Kaufmann, Christopher N. and Bai, Chen and Borgia, Brianne and

   and Zeidan, Rola S. and Manini, Todd M.","JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL
   SCIENCES",2024,"Background Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and other
   ChatBots have emerged as tools for interacting with information in
   manners resembling natural human speech. Consequently, the technology is
   used across various disciplines, including business, education, and even
   in biomedical sciences. There is a need to better understand how ChatGPT
   can be used to advance gerontology research. Therefore, we evaluated
   ChatGPT responses to questions on specific topics in gerontology
   research, and brainstormed recommendations for its use in the
   field.Methods We conducted semistructured brainstorming sessions to
   identify uses of ChatGPT in gerontology research. We divided a team of
   multidisciplinary researchers into 4 topical groups: (a) gero-clinical
   science, (b) basic geroscience, (c) informatics as it relates to
   electronic health records, and (d) gero-technology. Each group prompted
   ChatGPT on a theory-, methods-, and interpretation-based question and
   rated responses for accuracy and completeness based on standardized
   scales.Results ChatGPT responses were rated by all groups as generally
   accurate. However, the completeness of responses was rated lower, except
   by members of the informatics group, who rated responses as highly
   comprehensive.Conclusions ChatGPT accurately depicts some major concepts
   in gerontological research. However, researchers have an important role
   in critically appraising the completeness of its responses. Having a
   single generalized resource like ChatGPT may help summarize the
   preponderance of evidence in the field to identify gaps in knowledge and
   promote cross-disciplinary collaboration.",10.1093/gerona/glae184,
"Generative artificial intelligence (ChatGPT): Implications for
   management educators","Ratten, Vanessa and Jones, Paul",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION,2023,"ChatGPT has been one of the most talked about computer programs amongst
   management educators in recent weeks due to its transformative ability
   to change how assessments are undertaken and graded. Unlike other
   educational technologies that can be tracked when used, ChatGPT has
   superior abilities that make it virtually untraceable when used. This
   creates a dilemma for management educators wanting to utilise the
   technology whilst staying relevant but also interested in authentic
   learning. Thus, it is critical for management educators to quickly
   implement policies regarding ChatGPT and subsequent new generative
   artificial intelligence because of its ease of use and affordability.
   This article is conceptual in nature and discusses ChatGPT as a
   generative form of artificial intelligence that presents challenges for
   management educators that need to be addressed through appropriate
   strategies. Thereby contributing to the literature on how technological
   innovations can be included in curriculum design and management learning
   practices. Practical and managerial implications are stated that
   highlight the critical need to reexamine existing education practices as
   a way of incorporating new technological innovation that can be utilised

"Building entrepreneurial self-efficacy in the EdTech sector: the impact
   of an entrepreneurship education program","Ioannou, Andri and Retalis, Symeon",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LEARNING TECHNOLOGY,2025,"PurposeThe rapid advancement of technology in education is driving the
   digital transformation of schools and educational systems, creating an
   increasing demand for impactful EdTech solutions. While entrepreneurship
   education is widely recognized for its benefits, the effectiveness of
   such programs within the EdTech sector remains underexplored. Research
   has yet to comprehensively examine how entrepreneurship education
   tailored to EdTech influences entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) - a
   key determinant of entrepreneurial motivation, decision-making and
   success. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to evaluate an
   EdTech-focused entrepreneurship education program and its impact on
   participants' ESE. Quantitative results indicate a statistically
   significant increase in participants' self-efficacy across multiple
   dimensions, with medium to large effect sizes. The qualitative findings
   further reveal key mechanisms contributing to ESE growth, emphasizing
   the role of individualized mentoring, constructive feedback and a
   sector-specific focus. Notably, mentoring emerged as the most
   influential factor, enabling personalized learning experiences and
   exposure to entrepreneurial role models. This research contributes to
   both EdTech entrepreneurship and the broader field of learning
   technology by offering empirical evidence on how tailored
   entrepreneurship education programs can foster ESE. The findings
   underscore the importance of (1) explicitly addressing the unique
   challenges of the EdTech market, such as long sales cycles, and (2)
   integrating structured mentoring and coaching strategies to build
   participants' confidence. These insights provide a practical framework
   for designing and evaluating sector-specific entrepreneurship education
   programs, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable EdTech
   startups.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted a mixed-methods
   approach to address the research questions. It draws on qualitative and
   quantitative data collected from questionnaires and interviews with
   aspiring entrepreneurs (participants) as well as their trainers and
   mentors.FindingsWith regard to RQ1 (What is the impact of the
   entrepreneurship program on participants' ESE?), the program was
   successful in enhancing participants' ESE. The quantitative findings
   demonstrated statistically significant gains in ESE, with medium to
   large effect sizes. This indicates that the program had a meaningful
   impact on participants' confidence in their entrepreneurial abilities,
   in line with previous research showing that business development
   training can significantly enhance self-efficacy. With regard to RQ2 (In
   what ways does the program contribute to participants' ESE in the EdTech
   sector?), the qualitative findings provided rich insights into how ESE
   was developed within the context of EdTech entrepreneurship. Eight key
   themes emerged, which were organized into three pillars: ways of
   interaction, ways of teaching and coaching and program design
   specifics.Research limitations/implicationsUnderstanding how EdTech
   entrepreneurship education programs impact participants' ESE provides
   valuable insights for program design and helps predict performance
   outcomes, behaviors and decision-making. This study investigated ESE in
   the context of an entrepreneurship education program in the EdTech
   sector. Findings indicated that the program positively influenced
   participants' ESE, with mentoring emerging as the most impactful
   component, as it enabled individualized feedback and provided realistic
   voices from successful entrepreneurs.
   Practical implicationsThe study contributed new insights on fostering
   ESE, with direct implications for future program design, specifically
   emphasizing industry-specific focus: tailoring programs to the unique
   challenges and opportunities of specific markets, such as EdTech, and
   confidence-building strategies: structuring mentoring and coaching
   frameworks to explicitly enhance self-efficacy and mitigate fear of
   failure. Industry-specific focus can significantly enhance program
   effectiveness, while explicitly incorporating ESE-building strategies
   can bolster the confidence of aspiring entrepreneurs.Social
   implicationsAs entrepreneurial learning is increasingly explored
   globally, researchers and practitioners must collaborate to share best
   pedagogical practices and improve program quality, particularly in
   rapidly evolving fields like EdTech. In this work, EdTech
   entrepreneurship is not considered a business-oriented research or
   practice field, but rather a driver for research and innovation around
   technological advancements in learning and
   education.Originality/valueDespite the promising potential of EdTech
   entrepreneurship, research has yet to comprehensively examine the
   quality and effectiveness of EdTech-specific entrepreneurship education
   programs. While some literature discusses entrepreneurship education in
   general, studies dedicated to the EdTech sector remain scarce. This
   study seeks to bridge this gap by investigating an EdTech
   entrepreneurship education program with a specific focus on its impact
   on participants' ESE. Understanding how such programs influence ESE - a
   construct associated with behaviors, decision-making and business
   success - is critical for improving program design and ensuring
   long-term success in EdTech ventures.",10.1108/IJILT-12-2023-0234,
