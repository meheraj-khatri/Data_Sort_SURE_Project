Social networks are crowded with vast numbers of comments, opinions, and beliefs about different aspects of people’s daily lives. Opinions can directly express positive or negative perspectives toward a specific entity or its aspects, or they can be comparative opinions that present the differences or similarities between two or more entities, such as “product A is better than product B.” Comparative opinions have significant potential to offer new opportunities across various fields such as marketing, education, and e-commerce. Thus, analyzing comparative opinions is essential. Indeed, comparative opinion mining has been applied in several languages, including Arabic. Nevertheless, comparative opinion mining in Arabic is still in its early stages and requires more contributions and investigations. Therefore, this work introduces the ACOM approach for Arabic Comparative Opinion Mining. First, we collected the ACOM corpus in Arabic from the X platform, focusing on comparative opinions in the technology domain. This paper provides a benchmark comparison of several deep-learning models by employing different approaches, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the deep learning model, the generated representation vector was used to construct the embedding layer as the first layer. To this end, we adopted two pretrained word embedding techniques to investigate their effectiveness on the ACOM corpus: Word2vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The main highlight of this paper is leveraging the most advanced innovation in AI, the GPT-3 model, as a classifier model. Our experimental results show that BERT and BiLSTM achieved impressive performance on the ACOM task with 91% accuracy and a 90% F1-score.

It utilizes a project-based learning approach, where students are in teams of five. The course takes place over a full academic year, i.e., the fall and spring semesters. One of the aims of the course is to be as realistic as possible within an academic setting, with the students trying to create a new technology-based business, in the hopes that they will continue their ventures after the course concludes. Therefore, the teams were allowed to and encouraged to use any genAI they wish throughout the course to assist them. Outside of academia, it would be expected that a start-up founder would use genAl to speed up many aspects of starting their business. Therefore, we want to examine how the students use genAI without there being any constraints. As part of the summative assessment for the course each student peer assesses the members of their team. Included within that they also “peer assess” genAI as though it were another team member, which is a critical reflection of their genAI usage. This work addresses how students use genAI, in experiential-based learning courses when they are allowed to use it any way possible to assist them. The study uses a quantitative and qualitative approach with student data from their “peer assessment” (i.e., critical reflection) of their genAI usage from the academic year 2023/24. Within the peer assessment of the genAI team member the students answer Likert-scale statements to be rated on a five-point semantic differential scale. The results indicate a varied adoption and value of genAI across different project phases. While some students appreciated genAI for speeding up specific tasks, its contribution to creative processes like ideation was less impactful.","","979-8-3503-6741-6","10.1109/ICEED62316.2024.10923772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10923772","computer engineering;critical reflection;electrical engineering;experiential learning;student experience","Training;Electrical engineering;Generative AI;Soft sensors;Semantics;Project management;Entrepreneurship;Reflection;Springs;Engineering education","","","","10","IEEE","20 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Selection and Resource Allocation Strategies for Chatbot Technologies in Higher Education: An Optimization Model Approach","S. Wu; M.

This study explores the strategic integration of chatbot technologies, focusing on optimal selection and resource allocation to maximize educational efficacy. We developed a mathematical optimization model and introduced the “Relative Net Utility Differential” (RNUD) as a pivotal metric to facilitate the decision-making process for chatbot technology selection and resource distribution. Our findings reveal that when RNUD values for all chatbots fall within a specified range, the model efficiently determines the optimal resource allocations, providing clear analytical solutions for each technology. Additionally, we devised an algorithm for scenarios where RNUD values vary significantly, effectively isolating optimal solutions by excluding suboptimal choices. Numerical analysis confirms that this algorithm maintains robust performance and high computational efficiency, particularly when the chatbot count does not exceed 20. This efficiency persists across various distributions of chatbots’ technical attributes, and increasing the number of candidate chatbots generally enhances overall educational utility. This suggests that a diverse technological environment can lead to more tailored and effective educational interventions. Moreover, our study highlights a competitive interaction among chatbots: those with superior technical attributes tend to receive more resources. However, when the technical attributes of one chatbot improve, the resources allocated to others decrease, and vice versa. These insights underscore the importance of not only providing more sophisticated chatbots but also carefully managing their interactions to maximize overall educational utility.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3530413","University Philosophy and Social Sciences Research Program of Jiangsu Education Department(grant numbers:2023SJYB0731); Higher Education Reform Research Project of Higher Education Association of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:2023JSJG649); Scientific Research Foundation for High-Level Talents(grant numbers:RC2023-006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10843671","Chatbot technology;technology selection;resource allocation;mathematical modeling;higher education","Chatbots;Resource management;Education;Artificial intelligence;Electronic learning;Ethics;Solid modeling;Optimization models;Generative AI;Decision making","","2","","60","CCBYNCND","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The difficulty of video sentiment prediction mainly lies in the regression accuracy of long-term sequences and how to integrate different modalities. In particular, different modalities may express different emotions. In order to maintain the continuity of long time-series sentiments and mitigate the multimodal conflicts, this article proposes a novel Context-Based Adaptive Multimodal Fusion Network (CAMFNet) for consecutive frame-level sentiment prediction. A Context-based Transformer (CBT) module was specifically designed to embed clip features into continuous frame features, leveraging its capability to enhance the consistency of prediction results. Moreover, to resolve the multi-modal conflict between modalities, this article proposed an Adaptive multimodal fusion (AMF) method based on the self-attention mechanism. It can dynamically determines the degree of shared semantics across modalities, enabling the model to flexibly adapt its fusion strategy. Through adaptive fusion of multimodal features, the AMF method effectively resolves potential conflicts arising from diverse modalities, ultimately enhancing the overall performance of the model.
