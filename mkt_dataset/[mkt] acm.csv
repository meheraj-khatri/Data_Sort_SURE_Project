Context-Based Adaptive Multimodal Fusion Network for Continuous Frame-Level Sentiment Prediction,"Huang, Maochun and Qing, Chunmei and Tan, Junpeng and Xu, Xiangmin","IEEE/ACM Trans. Audio, Speech and Lang. Proc.",2023,"Recently, video sentiment computing has become the focus of research because of its benefits in many applications such as digital marketing, education, healthcare, and so on. The difficulty of video sentiment prediction mainly lies in the regression accuracy of long-term sequences and how to integrate different modalities. In particular, different modalities may express different emotions. In order to maintain the continuity of long time-series sentiments and mitigate the multimodal conflicts, this article proposes a novel Context-Based Adaptive Multimodal Fusion Network (CAMFNet) for consecutive frame-level sentiment prediction. A Context-based Transformer (CBT) module was specifically designed to embed clip features into continuous frame features, leveraging its capability to enhance the consistency of prediction results. Moreover, to resolve the multi-modal conflict between modalities, this article proposed an Adaptive multimodal fusion (AMF) method based on the self-attention mechanism. It can dynamically determines the degree of shared semantics across modalities, enabling the model to flexibly adapt its fusion strategy. Through adaptive fusion of multimodal features, the AMF method effectively resolves potential conflicts arising from diverse modalities, ultimately enhancing the overall performance of the model.

CareerSim: Gamification Design Leveraging LLMs For Career Development Reflection,"Du, Wantong and Zhu, Zhiying and Xu, Xinhui and Che, Haoyuan and Chen, Shi",Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2024,"Graduates often struggle with challenges in their careers stemming from a lack of self-construction and decisive decision-making. The HCI community increasingly focuses on gamification as a means to foster reflection, with the emerging developments in LLM providing new opportunities for personalized gamified experiences. However, existing solutions fall short in terms of personalization and real-world data references. In response, our research introduces CareerSim, a role-playing game that leverages LLM’s generation and reasoning capabilities. By integrating these with real-world based databases and game mechanics, we delve into gamification’s role in reflective self-construction and decision-making. We aim to inspire designers to effectively incorporate LLMs in gamification design.",10.1145/3613905.3650928,https://doi.org/10.1145/3613905.3650928
Beyond Binary: Towards Fine-Grained LLM-Generated Text Detection via Role Recognition and Involvement Measurement,"Cheng, Zihao and Zhou, Li and Jiang, Feng and Wang, Benyou and Li, Haizhou",Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2025,2025,"The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, has resulted in the widespread presence of LLM-generated content on social media platforms, raising concerns about misinformation, data biases, and privacy violations, which can undermine trust in online discourse. While detecting LLM-generated content is crucial for mitigating these risks, current methods often focus on binary classification, failing to address the complexities of real-world scenarios like human-LLM collaboration. To move beyond binary classification and address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm for detecting LLM-generated content. This approach introduces two novel tasks: LLM Role Recognition (LLM-RR), a multi-class classification task that identifies specific roles of an LLM in content generation, and LLM Involvement Measurement (LLM-IM), a regression task that quantifies the extent of LLM involvement in content creation. To support these tasks, we propose LLMDetect, a benchmark designed to evaluate detectors' performance on these new tasks. LLMDetect includes the Hybrid News Detection Corpus (HNDC) for training detectors, as well as DetectEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite that considers five distinct cross-context variations and two multi-intensity variations within the same LLM role. This allows for a thorough assessment of detectors' generalization and robustness across diverse contexts. Our empirical validation of 10 baseline detection methods demonstrates that fine-tuned Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-based models consistently outperform others on both tasks, while advanced LLMs face challenges in accurately detecting their own generated content. Our experimental results and analysis offer insights for developing more effective detection models for LLM-generated content. This research enhances the understanding of LLM-generated content and establishes a foundation for more nuanced detection methodologies.",10.1145/3696410.3714770,https://doi.org/10.1145/3696410.3714770

Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares: What We Must Do,"Baecker, Ronald M. and Grudin, Jonathan",,2024,"This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past.

Examining the Text-to-Image Community of Practice: Why and How do People Prompt Generative AIs?,,Proceedings of the 15th Conference on Creativity and Cognition,2023,"Image generation gained popularity with machine learning (ML) models generating images from text, fuelling new online communities of practices. This work explores the sociology, motivations, and usages of AI art hobbyists. We analyzed an online questionnaire answered by 64 practitioners and a dataset of user prompts sent to the Stable Diffusion generative model. Our findings suggest that TTI generation is a recreational activity mainly conducted by narrow socio-demographic groups who use auxiliary techniques across platforms and beyond request-response interactions. Inherent model limitations and finding suitable prompt formulation are the main obstacles practitioners face. A taxonomy and a corresponding ML model capable of recognizing the semantic content of unseen prompts were created to conduct the user prompt analysis. The prompt analysis revealed that artist names are the main specifier used beside the main subject, often in sequences. We finally discuss the design and socio-technical implications of our work for creativity support.",10.1145/3591196.3593051,https://doi.org/10.1145/3591196.3593051

Promote Caution about Using AI Prematurely,,Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares: What We Must Do,2024,"This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan",,https://doi.org/10.1145/3640479.3640496

Positive by Design: The Next Big Challenge in Rethinking Media as Agents?,"Antonini, Alessio",Proceedings of the 34th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media,2023,"Hypertext and Web pioneers had high aspirations and expectations about the potential positive impact of technology. However, studies in the last decades have shown how widely adopted social and intelligent media are either amplifiers or a source of adverse detrimental effects on their users. On the one hand, we now have a better understanding of these negative phenomena and strategies to identify and quantify their effects. On the other hand, as a community, we should take on the challenge of steering hypertext technologies toward positive applications. This position paper argues for a proactive role of the hypertext community in the design of agent media result of combining social media with intelligent algorithms. This silent paradigm shift introduced third-party proactive agents in a wide range of human-to-human interactions. We are today at a point where social media and global web applications cannot operate without such systems and demand, in the author's opinion, a similar proactive role of academia and scholars in understanding and driving their design for positive goals. This position paper outlines the need for this challenge to be taken on, and how and why the Hypertext community could lead in its own way this vision forward.",10.1145/3603163.3609068,https://doi.org/10.1145/3603163.3609068
Comparing the accuracy and efficiency of a single machine learning agent with multiple coordinating agents in a chat environment,"Lan, Hongxu",Proceedings of the 2025 2nd International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Information Security,2025,"This paper aims to design a chatbot application to help people find an appropriate restaurant based on users' preferences and transportation modes. It also aims to explore whether a machine learning-based chat agent is capable of accomplishing all the tasks precisely, or whether it could be optimized by collaborating with other simple agents. This paper establishes a chatbot environment along with a series of agents (machine learning agent, grammar checker agent, spelling checker agent, restaurant searcher), designed to assist users in finding a restaurant mainly based on what transportation they use and if a restaurant is found, the chatbot could display the route to this place in the prompt also with map details by employing the Google map API. The machine learning agent acting as the brain of this chatbot, could not only be able to evoke other agents corresponding to users’ input but also could directly store what kinds of transportation are taken by users and pass to Google map API to search appropriate restaurants instead of fully relying on a restaurant searcher agent (rule-based agent). To examine whether multiple agents coordinate with each other could outperform a single agent. A contrast experiment is conducted to conclude the result, which involves 15 participants who run through this program under two different setups (with and without spelling and grammar checkers) and each of them would give a query to this chatbot but this query would be dealt with and without spelling and grammar checker respectively. The result would be quantitatively evaluated by two metrics: Success Rate: successfully finding a restaurant and showing the map; the Total of Queries. Results suggest that pre-processing input with spelling and grammar checkers significantly improves the chatbot's performance, achieving an 80% success rate (12 out of 15 queries). In contrast, when input is not pre-processed, the success rate drops to 46.66% (7 out of 15 queries). This indicates that the involvement of spelling and grammar checker agents enhances the accuracy and efficiency of restaurant searches, making the collaborative multi-agent setup more effective. Moreover, it could demonstrate that this chatbot environment is well constructed since it could successfully provide suitable restaurants given users’ requirements.",,https://doi.org/10.1145/3728725.3728792

Theory entity extraction for social and behavioral sciences papers using distant supervision,"Wei, Xin and Salsabil, Lamia and Wu, Jian",Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Symposium on Document Engineering,2022,"Theories and models, which are common in scientific papers in almost all domains, usually provide the foundations of theoretical analysis and experiments. Understanding the use of theories and models can shed light on the credibility and reproducibility of research works. Compared with metadata, such as title, author, keywords, etc., theory extraction in scientific literature is rarely explored, especially for social and behavioral science (SBS) domains. One challenge of applying supervised learning methods is the lack of a large number of labeled samples for training. In this paper, we propose an automated framework based on distant supervision that leverages entity mentions from Wikipedia to build a ground truth corpus consisting of more than 4500 automatically annotated sentences containing theory/model mentions. We use this corpus to train models for theory extraction in SBS papers. We compared four deep learning architectures and found the RoBERTa-BiLSTM-CRF is the best one with a precision as high as 89.72%. The model is promising to be conveniently extended to domains other than SBS. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/lamps-lab/theory.",10.1145/3558100.3563855,https://doi.org/10.1145/3558100.3563855

Developing and Deploying a Real-World Solution for Accessible Slide Reading and Authoring for Blind Users,"Zhang, Zhuohao and Kim, Gene S-H and Wobbrock, Jacob O.",Proceedings of the 25th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility,2023,"Presentation software like Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides remains largely inaccessible for blind users because screen readers are not well suited to 2-D “artboards” that contain different objects in arbitrary arrangements lacking any inherent reading order. To investigate this problem, prior work by Zhang &amp; Wobbrock (2023) developed multimodal interaction techniques in a prototype system called A11yBoard, but their system was limited to a single artboard in a self-contained prototype and was unable to support real-world use. In this work, we present a major extension of A11yBoard that expands upon its initial interaction techniques, addresses numerous real-world issues, and makes it deployable with Google Slides. We describe the new features developed for A11yBoard for Google Slides along with our participatory design process with a blind co-author. We also present two case studies based on real-world deployments showing that participants were able to independently complete slide reading and authoring tasks that were not possible without sighted assistance previously. We conclude with several design guidelines for making accessible digital content creation tools.",10.1145/3597638.3608418,https://doi.org/10.1145/3597638.3608418

A Survey of K-12 Teacher Needs for an Online Programming Learning System,,Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2024,"This article examines US K-12 computing teacher needs for a programming learning system. We surveyed 39 K-12 teachers about the necessity of programming learning system features. We found that teachers needed to view student code remotely, student code auto-save, differentiation of student assignments, and a tutorial library for students to learn about the programming environment. In addition to rating feature usefulness, we also asked teachers to list features or needs that the survey did not address. Through qualitative responses, we found that teachers wanted cheating prevention and detection, the ability to freeze and project code onto student screens, and student and classroom-level analytics. We also compare the needs of teachers who teach computing as the main subject in their classroom to the needs of teachers who integrate computing into another discipline. This research can inform the development of programming learning systems to better support teachers and their students.",10.1145/3613905.3651110,https://doi.org/10.1145/3613905.3651110

"Can we create accessible charts with Microsoft Excel?: a review of possibilities and limits, with a special focus to users with low vision",,Proceedings of the XXIV International Conference on Human Computer Interaction,2024,"Introduction: statistical charts are key to data literacy and essential in the process of communicating abstract science concepts and relationships that are difficult to understand through other representations. These types of visualization can present numerous challenges for users with low vision, an often-overlooked group despite its enormous prevalence. To evaluate MS Excel's as an accessible authoring tool analyzing ATAG 2.0 compliance, and its capability to create accessible charts according to a set of heuristic indicators proposed by the authors. Methodology: Evaluate a) the compliance of Microsoft Excel software as an authoring tool with ATAG 2.0 guidelines; and b) the compliance of MS Excel-generated charts with a domain heuristic set. For the heuristic evaluation, apart from the original MS Excel chart (XSLX), three exported versions (DOCX, HTML and SVG) of the same chart were created using all the accessibility features available in the software. Results: Regarding ATAG compliance, 48 desired accessibility features applying to MS Excel have been identified and the software meet just 26 of them (54.17%). Regarding heuristic evaluation, the four versions of the chart present a percentage of compliance with the heuristics equal to or greater than 66.66%. The versions that have obtained the best scores are MS Excel original and MS Word exported charts with 72.2% of indicators achieved, followed by SVG and HTML exported charts, both with 66.66%. Even though MS Excel does not meet a good part of the ATAG 2.0 success criteria, it has been possible to create charts with a good level of accessibility following the suggested heuristic principles.",10.1145/3657242.3657243,https://doi.org/10.1145/3657242.3657243

The Sound of Support: Gendered Voice Agent as Support to Minority Teammates in Gender-Imbalanced Team,"Hwang, Angel Hsing-Chi and Won, Andrea Stevenson",Proceedings of the 2024 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2024,"The present work explores the potential of leveraging a teamwork agent’s identity – signaled through its gendered voice – to support marginalized individuals in gender-imbalanced teams. In a mixed design experiment (N = 178), participants were randomly assigned to work with a female and a male voice agent in either a female-dominated or male-dominated team. Results show the presence of a same-gender voice agent is particularly beneficial to the performance of minority female members, such that they would contribute more ideas and talk more when a female agent was present. Conversely, minority male members became more talkative but were less focused on the teamwork tasks at hand when working with a male-sounding agent. The findings of the present experiment support existing literature on the effect of social presence in gender-imbalanced teams, such that gendered agents serve similar benefits as human teammates of the same gender identities. However, the effect of agents’ presence remains limited when participants have experienced severe marginalization in the past. Based on findings from the present study, we discuss relevant design implications and avenues for future research.",10.1145/3613904.3642202,https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642202

Reflecting on Design Paradigms of Animated Data Video Tools,"Shen, Leixian and Li, Haotian and Wang, Yun and Qu, Huamin",Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2025,"Animated data videos have gained significant popularity in recent years. However, authoring data videos remains challenging due to the complexity of creating and coordinating diverse components (e.g., visualization, animation, audio, etc.). Although numerous tools have been developed to streamline the process, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding and reflection of their design paradigms to inform future development. To address this gap, we propose a framework for understanding data video creation tools along two dimensions: what data video components to create and coordinate, including visual, motion, narrative, and audio components, and how to support the creation and coordination. By applying the framework to analyze 46 existing tools, we summarized key design paradigms of creating and coordinating each component based on the varying work distribution for humans and AI in these tools. Finally, we share our detailed reflections, highlight gaps from a holistic view, and discuss future directions to address them.",10.1145/3706598.3713449,https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3713449
