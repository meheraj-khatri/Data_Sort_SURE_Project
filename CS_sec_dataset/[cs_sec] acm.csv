Hence, it is essential to train the next generation of cybersecurity learners not only on how to use AI technology but also on how to leverage these technologies to enhance the efficiency of their work. This extended abstract describes our exploratory work on the use of generative AI-based pedagogical approaches in cybersecurity education. This extended abstract will describe some preliminary findings on large language model-powered pedagogical approaches to cybersecurity education and training. These approaches will help cybersecurity educators enhance their teaching methods to equip learners with the essential skills needed to succeed in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.",10.1145/3686852.3686887,https://doi.org/10.1145/3686852.3686887
Enhancing Cybersecurity Education with Artificial Intelligence Content,"Brito, Fernando and Mekdad, Yassine and Ross, Monique and Finlayson, Mark A. and Uluagac, Selcuk",Proceedings of the 56th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1,2025,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners. It is frequently used to address major security problems such as supply chain attacks, ransomware threats, and social engineering. In this context, integrating AI into cybersecurity workflows requires incorporating AI-driven approaches into the educational training of the cybersecurity workforce. This paradigm shift in academic settings will introduce the necessary skills for cybersecurity professionals to operate modern AI-based systems. Yet, the current cybersecurity curriculum still suffers from the absence of AI resources, particularly the detailed understanding of the appropriate AI mechanisms. Such absence leaves skill gaps for future professionals and practitioners in the industry. To address this, we designed an academic lecture module on AI covering both theory and practice. Then, we taught the module across six cybersecurity courses in our institution. To assess the effectiveness of integrating AI materials into cybersecurity education, we collected data by presenting two surveys before and after the lecture (concluding 81 participants per survey). Specifically, we utilized widely accepted models for unbiased analysis of our data. Our experimental results show positive AI knowledge improvement by 30% of the participants, demonstrating the beneficial impact of the lecture. Then, we observed a high similarity score between the survey responses and the lecture content, reaching 84%. Moreover, our sentiment analysis results reflect positive feedback from the participants with a positive score of 0.50. Overall, our study serves as a reference for instructional designers for developing educational curricula aiming to integrate AI into cybersecurity education.",10.1145/3641554.3701958,https://doi.org/10.1145/3641554.3701958
Enhancing Cybersecurity Curriculum Development: AI-Driven Mapping and Optimization Techniques,,"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security",2024,"Cybersecurity has become important, especially during the last decade. The significant growth of information technologies, internet of things, and digitalization in general, increased the interest in cybersecurity professionals significantly. While the demand for cybersecurity professionals is high, there is a significant shortage of these professionals due to the very diverse landscape of knowledge and the complex curriculum accreditation process.

Case Study 2: Mapping between an E-Voting Curriculum and the DHS/NSA CAE Knowledge Units,"Sanchez, Edwin Antonio and Zheng, Muwei and Bishop, Matt and Zou, Xukai",Proceedings of the 56th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1,2025,"To become a DHS/NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD), academic institutions must satisfy several specific Knowledge Units (KUs). How they achieve this is up to the institutions. In this case study, we follow the methodology of an earlier work to demonstrate how key parts of an electronic voting (E-voting)-oriented cybersecurity curriculum, proposed by Hostler et al. [4] in 2021, maps into the DHS/NSA KUs supporting the CAE-CD designation, from two aspects: E-voting principle based topics, i.e., from theory and a plug-and-play e-voting system's composing components, i.e., from practice. We grouped CAE-CD KUs into those required as prerequisites, closely related, related/supported, and not covered by the E-voting curriculum. Teachers can then choose which KUs they will use and teach using only the parts of the E-voting-oriented curriculum they deem relevant, and in a depth they find appropriate to their educational objectives, while meeting the requirements of the selected KUs. We conclude with a discussion of how LLMs (Large Language Models) and quantum computing might be added to the E-voting-oriented curriculum.",10.1145/3641554.3701960,https://doi.org/10.1145/3641554.3701960
SENSAI: Large Language Models as Applied Cybersecurity Tutors,,Proceedings of the 56th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1,2025,"The modern educational landscape faces the challenge of maintaining effective, personalized mentorship amid expanding class sizes.

Assessing the Effectiveness of ChatGPT in Secure Code Development: A Systematic Literature Review,"Bouzid, Rezika and Khoury, Rapha\",ACM Comput. Surv.,2025,"ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM) maintained by OpenAI, has demonstrated a remarkable ability to seemingly comprehend and contextually generate text. Among its myriad applications, its capability to autonomously generate and analyze computer code stands out as particularly promising. This functionality has piqued substantial interest due to its potential to streamline the software development process. However, this technological advancement also brings to the forefront significant apprehensions concerning the security of code produced by LLMs. In this paper, we survey recent research that examines the use of ChatGPT to generate secure code, detect vulnerabilities in code, or perform other tasks related to secure code development. Beyond categorizing and synthesizing these studies, we identify important insights into ChatGPT’s potential impact on secure programming. Key findings indicate that while ChatGPT shows great promise as an aid in writing secure code, challenges remain. Its effectiveness varies across security tasks, depending on the context of experimentation (e.g., programming language, CWE, code length, etc.) and the benchmark used for comparison—whether against other LLMs, traditional analysis tools, or its own versions. The overall trend indicates that GPT-4 consistently surpasses its predecessor in most tasks.",10.1145/3744553,https://doi.org/10.1145/3744553
ChatGPT as an Assembly Language Interpreter for Computing Education,"Zuo, Fei and Tompkins, Cody and Qian, Gang and Rhee, Junghwan and Qu, Xianshan and Yang, Bokai",J. Comput. Sci. Coll.,2024,"Assembly language is a low-level programming language useful for a number of important computing areas, such as hardware and embedded systems programming, computer architecture, reverse engineering, and malware analysis. In recent years, generative AI, enhanced by GPT technology, has been widely adopted in the IT industry as well as computing education. However, little work has been done to investigate the applicability of GPT to teaching assembly language. In this paper, we fill in the gap by providing an empirical study of GPT's ability to interpret assembly instructions. In particular, we manually evaluated GPT-4's per-instruction explanations of code segments for four different computer architectures, namely x86, x86-64, ARM, and AArch64. Our study shows that, while inconsistencies and rare errors do exist, GPT's interpretations are highly accurate in general, demonstrating a great potential for such tools to be applied in pedagogical practices for tutoring assembly language.",,
Validation of an Instrument to Measure Self-Efficacy in Information Security,"Tise, Joseph C. and McGill, Monica M.",Proceedings of the 2024 on ACM Virtual Global Computing Education Conference V. 1,2024,"Problem. Extant measures of students' cybersecurity self-efficacy lack sufficient evidence of validity based on internal structure. Such evidence of validity is needed to enhance confidence in conclusions drawn from use of self-efficacy measures in the cybersecurity domain. Research Question. To address this identified problem, we sought to answer our research question: What is the underlying factor structure of a new self-efficacy for Information Security measure?   Method. We leveraged exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the number of factors underlying a new measure of student self-efficacy to conduct information security. This measure was created to align with the five elements of the information security section of the K-12 cybersecurity Education framework. Participants were 190 undergraduate students recruited from computer science courses across the U.S.  Findings. Results from the EFA indicated that a four-factor solution best fit the data while maximizing interpretability of the factors. The internal reliability of the measure was quite strong (α = .99).  Implications. The psychometric quality of this measure was demonstrated, and thus evidence of validity based on internal structure has been established. Future work will conduct a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and assess measurement invariance across subgroups of interest (e.g., over- vs. under-represented race/ethnicity groups, gender).",10.1145/3649165.3690095,https://doi.org/10.1145/3649165.3690095

Bridging the Community College Cybersecurity Classroom and Workplace with the CyberSim Lab,,Proceedings of the 56th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1,2025,"Most postsecondary cybersecurity education focuses on technical knowledge and skills without commensurate attention to vital non-technical skills. In this position paper, we argue that cybersecurity education must integrate teaching and practicing of non-technical competencies alongside technical knowledge and skills to ensure that both technical and non-technical skills transfer to cybersecurity workplaces. We identify specific learning outcomes that meet these criteria and suggest research-based pedagogical approaches to support learning and transfer. We present a cybersecurity lab designed to address these learning outcomes through experiential learning, roleplay, collaborative learning, technical simulation and metacognitive engagement.

Cybersecurity Exercises in the Age of LLMs,"Weiss, Richard and Mache, Jens",J. Comput. Sci. Coll.,2024,"In this tutorial, we will introduce a cybersecurity education framework for developing polymorphic hands-on exercises. Many faculty readily acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity in the Computer Science curriculum, but there are still barriers to integrating it into existing courses. One of those barriers is the fact that in most courses, the current content fills the entire term. Another issues is that faculty don't have time and expertise to create new content that would fit well with their current content and style. The third problem is that exercises created should be resistant to solution by LLMs. We have developed cybersecurity exercises that combine two principles: environment specificity and polymorphism. Environment specificity means that the solutions to the exercise should depend on the local environment (LLMs don't have access to that information). In this context, polymorphism means that they can be easily modified each time that the class is taught.",,
Cracking Aegis: An Adversarial LLM-based Game for Raising Awareness of Vulnerabilities in Privacy Protection,"Fu, Jiaying and Lu, Yiyang and Yang, Zehua and Nah, Fiona and LC, RAY",Proceedings of the 2025 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference,2025,"Traditional methods for raising awareness of privacy protection often fail to engage users or provide hands-on insights into how privacy vulnerabilities are exploited. To address this, we incorporate an adversarial mechanic in the design of the dialogue-based serious game Cracking Aegis. Leveraging LLMs to simulate natural interactions, the game challenges players to impersonate characters and extract sensitive information from an AI agent, Aegis. A user study (n=22) revealed that players employed diverse deceptive linguistic strategies, including storytelling and emotional rapport, to manipulate Aegis. After playing, players reported connecting in-game scenarios with real-world privacy vulnerabilities, such as phishing and impersonation, and expressed intentions to strengthen privacy control, such as avoiding oversharing personal information with AI systems.

"From Embodied Abuse to Mass Disruption: Generative, Inter-Reality Threats in Social, Mixed-Reality Platforms","Baldry, Moya Kate and Happa, Jassim and Steed, Anthony and Smith, Simon and Glencross, Mashhuda",Digital Threats,2024,"Extended Reality (XR) platforms can expose users to novel attacks including embodied abuse and/or AI attacks-at-scale. The expanded attack surfaces of XR technologies may expose users of shared online platforms to psychological/social and physiological harms via embodied interactions with potentially millions of other humans or artificial humans, causing what we define as an inter-reality attack. The past 20 years have demonstrated how social and other harms (e.g., bullying, assault and stalking) can and do shift to digital social media and gaming platforms. XR technologies becoming more mainstream has led to investigations of ethical and technical consequences of these expanded input surfaces. However, there is limited literature that investigates social attacks, particularly towards vulnerable communities, and how AI technologies may accelerate generative attacks-at-scale. This article employs human-centred research methods and a harms-centred Cybersecurity framework to co-design a testbed of socio-technical attack scenarios in XR social gaming platforms. It uses speculative fiction to further extrapolate how these could reach attacks-at-scale by applying generative AI techniques. It develops an Inter-Reality Threat Model to outline how actions in virtual environments can impact on the real-world.

Software Security Analysis in 2030 and Beyond: A Research Roadmap,B\,ACM Trans. Softw. Eng. Methodol.,2025,"As our lives, our businesses, and indeed our world economy become increasingly reliant on the secure operation of many interconnected software systems, the software engineering research community is faced with unprecedented research challenges, but also with exciting new opportunities. In this roadmap article, we outline our vision of software security analysis for the systems of the future. Given the recent advances in generative AI, we need new methods to assess and maximize the security of code co-written by machines. As our systems become increasingly heterogeneous, we need practical approaches that work even if some functions are automatically generated, e.g., by deep neural networks. As software systems depend evermore on the software supply chain, we need tools that scale to an entire ecosystem. What kind of vulnerabilities exist in future systems and how do we detect them? When all the shallow bugs are found, how do we discover vulnerabilities hidden deeply in the system? Assuming we cannot find all security flaws, how can we nevertheless protect our system? To answer these questions, we start our roadmap with a survey of recent advances in software security, then discuss open challenges and opportunities, and conclude with a long-term perspective for the field.",10.1145/3708533,https://doi.org/10.1145/3708533

CulturAI: Exploring Mixed Reality Art Exhibitions with Large Language Models for Personalized Immersive Experiences,"Constantinides, Nicolas and Constantinides, Argyris and Koukopoulos, Dimitrios and Fidas, Christos and Belk, Marios","Adjunct Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization",2024,"Mixed Reality (MR) technologies have transformed the way in which we interact and engage with digital content, offering immersive experiences that blend the physical and virtual worlds. Over the past years, there has been increasing interest in employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to improve user experience and trustworthiness in cultural contexts. However, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into MR applications within the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain is relatively underexplored. In this work, we present an investigation into the integration of LLMs within MR environments, focusing on the context of virtual art exhibitions. We implemented a HoloLens MR application, which enables users to explore artworks while interacting with an LLM through voice. To evaluate the user experience and perceived trustworthiness of individuals engaging with an LLM-based virtual art guide, we adopted a between-subject study design, in which participants were randomly assigned to either the LLM-based version or a control group using conventional interaction methods. The LLM-based version allows users to pose inquiries about the artwork displayed, ranging from details about the creator to information about the artwork’s origin and historical significance. This paper presents the technical aspects of integrating LLMs within MR applications and evaluates the user experience and perceived trustworthiness of this approach in enhancing the exploration of virtual art exhibitions. Results of an initial evaluation provide evidence about the positive aspect of integrating LLMs in MR applications. Findings of this work contribute to the advancement of MR technologies for the development of future interactive personalized art experiences.",10.1145/3631700.3664874,https://doi.org/10.1145/3631700.3664874

Examining the Differences in Three Computing Fields with High School Students,"Perkins Coppola, Matthew and Kim, Beomjin and Parker, Michelle and Wang, Guoping and Bolinger, Thomas",Proceedings of the 25th Annual Conference on Information Technology Education,2024,"Anecdotal evidence from admissions visits and conversations with students suggested that high school students received little to no guidance from school counselors and teachers on the differences between computer science (CS), computer engineering (CmpE), and information technology (IT) or the high school coursework needed to position students for success. Retention rates in these undergraduate computing degree programs were impacted by this lack of information and guidance, with local four-year graduation rates in just above 20% and four-year retention rates hovering just above 50%. Many of those students had selected the wrong major for their personal interests or career goals. To address this problem prior to attending a university, an interdisciplinary research team consisting of four faculty members from CS, CmpE, and IT and a fifth from education (EDU) developed the one-week Summer Computing Camp (SCC) for high school students. The SCC curriculum aimed to increase students' understanding of computing-related majors and to promote higher education in computing fields. Campers received daily instruction on the core components of CS, CmpE, and IT and practical experience in each through hands-on laboratories. Specific skills developed include computer programming in Python, basics of electrical circuits, integrating computer hardware and software, computer networking, and cyber security. Campers were introduced to computing careers and majors through presentations and guest speakers during the Lunch and Learn time. At the end of the week, teams of campers applied these skills to an Internet of Things-themed Capstone project, which they presented to their peers and parents. Pre- and post-surveys and tests provided evidence that camp participants increased their understanding of the differences between CS, CmpE, and IT as well as the career trajectories associated with each. Evidence also suggests that camp participants left the program more confident as to which computing field they were most interested in pursuing.",10.1145/3686852.3687070,https://doi.org/10.1145/3686852.3687070

From Awareness to Action: The Effects of Experiential Learning on Educating Users about Dark Patterns,"Ye, Jingzhou and Li, Yao and Zou, Wenting and Wang, Xueqiang",Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2025,"Dark patterns (DPs) refer to unethical user interface designs that deceive users into making unintended decisions, compromising their privacy, safety, financial security, and more. Prior research has mainly focused on defining and classifying DPs, as well as assessing their impact on users, while legislative and technical efforts to mitigate them remain limited. Consequently, users are still exposed to DP risks, making it urgent to educate them on avoiding these harms. However, there has been little focus on developing educational interventions for DP awareness. This study addresses this gap by introducing DPTrek, an experiential learning (EL) platform that educates users through simulated real-world DP cases. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the effectiveness of DPTrek in helping users identify and manage DPs. The study also offers insights for future DP education and research, highlighting challenges such as user-unfriendly taxonomies and the lack of practical mitigation solutions.",10.1145/3706598.3713493,https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3713493

Phishing to improve detection,"Zheng, Sarah Ying and Becker, Ingolf",Proceedings of the 2023 European Symposium on Usable Security,2023,"Phishing e-mail scams continue to threaten organisations around the world. With generative artificial intelligence, conventional phishing detection advice such as looking out for linguistic errors and bad layouts will become obsolete. New approaches to improve people’s ability to detect phishing are essential. We report on promising results from two experiments (total N = 183) that engaging people with an adversarial mindset improves their ability to detect phishing e-mails compared to those who received conventional or no training. Participants who completed conventional training were nearly three times as likely to fall for a simulated phishing attack compared to those who completed the adversarial training, in which they watched a fictitious cybercriminal explain how to devise a targeted phishing e-mail, and then wrote targeted phishing e-mails themselves. Although further research is needed to examine the training’s long-term efficacy with larger sample sizes, the present findings show an encouraging alternative to conventional phishing training approaches.",10.1145/3617072.3617121,https://doi.org/10.1145/3617072.3617121
HexT5: Unified Pre-Training for Stripped Binary Code Information Inference,"Xiong, Jiaqi and Chen, Guoqiang and Chen, Kejiang and Gao, Han and Cheng, Shaoyin and Zhang, Weiming",Proceedings of the 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,2024,"Decompilation is a widely used process for reverse engineers to significantly enhance code readability by lifting assembly code to a higher-level C-like language, pseudo-code. Nevertheless, the process of compilation and stripping irreversibly discards high-level semantic information that is crucial to code comprehension, such as comments, identifier names, and types. Existing approaches typically recover only one type of information, making them suboptimal for semantic inference. In this paper, we treat pseudo-code as a special programming language, then present a unified pre-trained model, HexT5, that is trained on vast amounts of natural language comments, source identifiers, and pseudo-code using novel pseudo-code-based pretraining objectives. We fine-tune HexT5 on various downstream tasks, including code summarization, variable name recovery, function name recovery, and similarity detection. Comprehensive experiments show that HexT5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on four downstream tasks, and it demonstrates the robust effectiveness and generalizability of HexT5 for binary-related tasks.",10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00099,https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00099

"Embedding Technical, Personal and Professional Competencies in Computing Degree Programmes","Prickett, Tom and Crick, Tom and Davenport, James H. and Bowers, David S. and Hayes, Alan and Irons, Alastair",Proceedings of the 2024 on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education V. 1,2024,"Many factors influence computing graduate employment prospects, including human capital, social capital, individual attributes, individual career-building behaviours, perceived employability, and labour market factors. Whilst most computing graduates go on to be beneficially employed, a small minority remain under-employed or unemployed. Computing curricular recommendations increasingly advocate a competency-based approach to bolster graduates' perceived employability. Hence, the discipline is evolving to incorporate competency-based approaches. However, competency-based can mean any of three different types of competency: technical, personal and professional. Technical Competency is the ability to apply acquired content knowledge and skills to develop solutions to unseen problems. Personal Competency is the personal behaviours and interpersonal skills required for success in the modern workplace. Professional Competency is Technical and Personal combined and applied in a real-world context.This position paper provides illustrative examples of how to embed all three kinds of Competency. Based on examples from representative undergraduate computing programmes at UK universities, it provides examples of embedding each kind of competency: Technical Competency (teaching programming through craft computing and approaches for developing cybersecurity competency), Personal Competency (teaching teamwork through project-based learning and creativity via problem-based learning), and Professional Competency (developing work-ready competency using industrial placements, and co-design/co-delivery with industry via degree apprenticeships), providing a valuable foundation and framing for portability and extension in other institutions and jurisdictions. Furthermore, these distinctive types of competency form a helpful taxonomy when considering how to embed competency in computing courses and are candidates for inclusion within future computing curricula guidelines.",10.1145/3649217.3653578,https://doi.org/10.1145/3649217.3653578

Not Quite There Yet: Remaining Challenges in Systems and Software Product Line Engineering as Perceived by Industry Practitioners,"Becker, Martin and Rabiser, Rick and Botterweck, Goetz",Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference,2024,"Research on system and software product line engineering (SPLE) and the community around it have been inspired by industrial applications. However, despite decades of research, industry is still struggling with adopting product line approaches and more generally with managing system variability. We argue that it is essential to better understand why this is the case. Particularly, we need to understand the current challenges industry is facing wrt. adopting SPLE practices, how far existing research helps industry practitioners to cope with their challenges, and where additional research would be required. We conducted a hybrid workshop at the 2023 Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) with over 30 participants from industry and academia. 9 companies from diverse domains and in different phases of SPLE adoption presented their context and perceived challenges. We grouped, discussed, and rated the relevance of the articulated challenges. We then formed clusters of relevant research topics to discuss existing literature as well as research opportunities. In this paper, we report the industry cases, the identified challenges and clusters of research topics, provide pointers to existing work, and discuss research opportunities. With this, we want to enable industry practitioners to become aware of typical challenges and find their way into the existing body of knowledge and to relevant fields of research.",10.1145/3646548.3672587,https://doi.org/10.1145/3646548.3672587
Investigating Cybersecurity Risks and the Responses of Home Workers in Aotearoa New Zealand,"Patterson, Lisa and Welch, Ian and Ng, Bryan and Chard, Sue",Proceedings of the 35th Australian Computer-Human Interaction Conference,2024,"The Covid-19 pandemic led to users worldwide increasingly working remotely, usually from their homes. Home workers are exposed to increased cybersecurity risks. We conducted semi structured interviews with a sample of everyday home workers in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) to explore how this group understands and reacts to cybersecurity risks. Findings show that there are many cybersecurity risks that these home workers are unaware of, or only partially aware of. Where these home workers have some awareness, we map their responses to four key risk-response strategies. We investigate the reasons behind this behaviour, and make suggestions to address these risks. It is imperative that risks to the home worker in Aotearoa NZ are identified and understood, so that appropriate mitigations can be designed, and interventions recommended. This paper highlights the cybersecurity risks to home workers from a New Zealand perspective, which has not been widely explored in academic literature.",10.1145/3638380.3638385,https://doi.org/10.1145/3638380.3638385

Although gathering and analyzing data for research seem straightforward, making research data publicly available to the community remains a challenge. Likewise, finding and reusing high-quality, prominent, and well-documented research data proves to be a daunting task. In this working group paper, the authors present their search for available datasets in the CER context (e.g., in databases and repositories). The available datasets are further analyzed using a newly developed metadata scheme and presented to the community as a resource. The second component of this work is a summary of the community's perspective and concerns on publishing their research data, which has been gathered through a survey among 52 computing education researchers. Based on this status quo, this report presents recommendations for measures and future steps for the community to become more accessible and establish open data practices. We thus emphasize the potential of making research data available to enhance productivity, transparency, and reproducibility in the CER community.",10.1145/3598579.3689378,https://doi.org/10.1145/3598579.3689378

The Explanation That Hits Home: The Characteristics of Verbal Explanations That Affect Human Perception in Subjective Decision-Making,"Ferguson, Sharon and Aoyagui, Paula Akemi and Rizvi, Rimsha and Kim, Young-Ho and Kuzminykh, Anastasia",Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.,2024,"Human-AI collaborative decision-making can achieve better outcomes than either party individually. The success of this collaboration can depend on whether the human decision-maker perceives the AI contribution as beneficial to the decision-making process. Beneficial AI explanations are often described as relevant, convincing, and trustworthy. Yet, we know little about the characteristics of explanations that result in these perceptions. Focusing on collaborative subjective decision-making, using the context of subtle sexism, where explanations can surface new interpretations, we conducted a user study (N=20) to explore the structural and content characteristics that affect perceptions of human and AI-generated verbal (text and audio) explanations. We find four groups of characteristics (Tone, Grammatical Elements, Argumentative Sophistication and Relation to User), and that the effect of these characteristics on the perception of explanations for subtle sexism depends on the perceived author. Thus, we also identify which explanation characteristics participants use to identify the author of an explanation. Demonstrating the relationship between these characteristics and explanation perceptions, we present a categorized set of characteristics that system builders can leverage to produce the appropriate perception of an explanation for various sensitive contexts. We also highlight human perception biases and associated issues resulting from these perceptions.",10.1145/3687056,https://doi.org/10.1145/3687056

Detecting Misuse of Security APIs: A Systematic Review,"Mosavi, Seyedehzahra and Islam, Chadni and Babar, Muhammad Ali and Abuadbba, Sharif and Moore, Kristen",ACM Comput. Surv.,2025,"Security Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial for ensuring software security. However, their misuse introduces vulnerabilities, potentially leading to severe data breaches and substantial financial loss. Complex API design, inadequate documentation, and insufficient security training often lead to unintentional misuse by developers. The software security community has devised and evaluated several approaches to detecting security API misuse to help developers and organizations. This study rigorously reviews the literature on detecting misuse of security APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of this critical domain. Our goal is to identify and analyze security API misuses, the detection approaches developed, and the evaluation methodologies employed along with the open research avenues to advance the state-of-the-art in this area. Employing the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, we analyzed 69 research papers. Our review has yielded (a) identification of 6 security API types; (b) classification of 30 distinct misuses; (c) categorization of detection techniques into heuristic-based and ML-based approaches; and (d) identification of 10 performance measures and 9 evaluation benchmarks. The review reveals a lack of coverage of detection approaches in several areas. We recommend that future efforts focus on aligning security API development with developers’ needs and advancing standardized evaluation methods for detection technologies.",10.1145/3735968,https://doi.org/10.1145/3735968

It's Trying Too Hard To Look Real: Deepfake Moderation Mistakes and Identity-Based Bias,"Mink, Jaron and Wei, Miranda and Munyendo, Collins W. and Hugenberg, Kurt and Kohno, Tadayoshi and Redmiles, Elissa M. and Wang, Gang",Proceedings of the 2024 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2024,"Online platforms employ manual human moderation to distinguish human-created social media profiles from deepfake-generated ones. Biased misclassification of real profiles as artificial can harm general users as well as specific identity groups; however, no work has yet systematically investigated such mistakes and biases. We conducted a user study (n=695) that investigates how 1) the identity of the profile, 2) whether the moderator shares that identity, and 3) components of a profile shown affect the perceived artificiality of the profile. We find statistically significant biases in people’s moderation of LinkedIn profiles based on all three factors. Further, upon examining how moderators make decisions, we find they rely on mental models of AI and attackers, as well as typicality expectations (how they think the world works). The latter includes reliance on race/gender stereotypes. Based on our findings, we synthesize recommendations for the design of moderation interfaces, moderation teams, and security training.",10.1145/3613904.3641999,https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3641999

Multi-Institutional Multi-National Studies of Parsons Problems,"Ericson, Barbara J. and Pearce, Janice L. and Rodger, Susan H. and Csizmadia, Andrew and Garcia, Rita and Gutierrez, Francisco J. and Liaskos, Konstantinos and Padiyath, Aadarsh and Scott, Michael James and Smith, David H. and Warriem, Jayakrishnan M. and Zavaleta Bernuy, Angela",Proceedings of the 2023 Working Group Reports on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,2023,"Students are often asked to learn programming by writing code from scratch. However, many novices struggle to write code and get frustrated when their code does not work. Parsons problems can reduce the difficulty of a coding problem by providing mixed-up blocks the learner rearranges into the correct order. These mixed-up blocks can include distractor blocks that are not needed in a correct solution. Distractor blocks can include common errors, which may help students learn to recognize and fix such errors. Evidence suggests students find Parsons problems engaging, useful for learning to program, and typically easier and faster to solve than writing code from scratch, but with equivalent learning gains. Most research on Parsons problems prior to this work has been conducted at a single institution. This work addresses the need for replication across multiple contexts.A 2022 ITiCSE Parsons Problems Working Group conducted an extensive literature review of Parsons problems, designed several experimental studies for Parsons problems in Python, and created 'study-in-a-box' materials to help instructors run the experimental studies, but the 2022 working group had only sufficient time to pilot two of these studies.Our 2023 ITiCSE Parsons Problems Working Group reviewed these studies, revised some of the studies, expanded both the programming and natural languages used in some of the studies, created new studies, conducted think-aloud observations on some of the studies, and ran both revised as well as new experimental studies. The think-aloud observations and experimental studies provide evidence for using Parsons problems to help students learn common algorithms such as swap, and the usefulness of distractors in helping students learn to recognize, fix, and avoid common errors. In addition, our 2023 ITiCSE Parsons Problems Working Group reviewed Parsons problem papers published after the 2022 literature review and provided a literature review of multi-national (MIMN) studies conducted in computer science education to better understand the motivations and challenges in performing such MIMN studies.In summary, this article contributes an analysis of recent Parsons problem research papers, an itemization of considerations for MIMN studies, the results from our MIMN studies of Parsons problems, and a discussion of recent and future directions for MIMN studies of Parsons problems and more generally.",10.1145/3623762.3633498,https://doi.org/10.1145/3623762.3633498

Vulnerably (Mis)Configured? Exploring 10 Years of Developers' Q&amp;As on Stack Overflow,"May, Richard and Biermann, Christian and Zerweck, Xenia Marlene and Ludwig, Kai and Kr\",Proceedings of the 18th International Working Conference on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems,2024,"The increasing number of attacks exploiting system vulnerabilities in recent years underpins the growing importance of security; especially for software comprising configuration options that may cause unintended vulnerabilities. So, not surprisingly, developers discuss secure software configurations extensively, for instance, via community-question-answering systems like Stack Overflow. In this exploratory study, we analyzed 651 Stack Overflow posts from 2013 until 2022 to investigate what vulnerabilities in the context of configuring software developers discuss. We employed a manual data analysis and automated topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify and classify relevant topics and contexts. Our results show that vulnerabilities in the context of configuring receive more and more interest, with most posts discussing issues related to faulty security configurations and dependencies causing vulnerabilities that could be or have actually been exploited. Overall, we contribute insights into configuration and security issues that developers experience in the real world. Such insights help researchers and practitioners understand and resolve these issues, thereby guiding future improvements.",10.1145/3634713.3634729,https://doi.org/10.1145/3634713.3634729
Skipping the Security Side Quests: A Qualitative Study on Security Practices and Challenges in Game Development,"Klostermeyer, Philip and Klivan, Sabrina and H\",Proceedings of the 2024 on ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2024,"The video game market is one of the biggest for software products. Video game development has progressed in the last decades to complex and multifaceted endeavors. Games-as-a-Service significantly impacted distribution and gameplay, requiring providers and developers to consider factors beyond game functionality, including security and privacy. New security challenges emerged, including authentication, payment security, and user data or asset protection. However, the security community lacks in-depth insights into the security experiences, challenges, and practices of modern video game development. This paper aims to address this gap in research and highlights the criticality of considering security in the process.Therefore, we conducted 20 qualitative, semi-structured interviews with various roles of professional and skilled video game development experts, investigating awareness, priorities, knowledge, and practices regarding security in the industry through their first-hand experiences. We find that stakeholders are aware of the urgency of security and related issues. However, they often face obstacles, including a lack of money, time, and knowledge, which force them to put security issues lower in priority. We conclude our work by recommending how the game industry can incorporate security into its development processes while balancing other resources and priorities and illustrating ideas for future research.",10.1145/3658644.3690190,https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3690190
