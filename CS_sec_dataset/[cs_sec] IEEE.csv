Designing and Constructing Authentic Assessments for Cybersecurity Education,J. Dwight,2025 13th International Conference on Information and Education Technology (ICIET),2025,"This paper explores the development of authentic assessments for cybersecurity education using the Villarroel Model. Despite numerous educational initiatives worldwide, there remains a significant shortage of experienced cybersecurity professionals. Better educational materials must be used to attract students to the field. Additionally, with Gartner predicting that over 80 % of enterprises will have used generative AI by 2026, there is an urgent need to incorporate emerging technologies into cybersecurity education. Authentic assessments can help develop university students better for workforce needs. This study adapts the Villarroel Authentic Assessment model to create a industryrelevant framework to develop practical assessments for cybersecurity students. To demonstrate the use of the framework, an authentic assessment was designed for first-year information technology students at RMIT University in Vietnam. The research demonstrates how authentic assessments can be effectively designed by combining industry standards, professional expertise, and contemporary technological trends to prepare students for real-world cybersecurity challenges.",10.1109/ICIET66371.2025.11046244,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11046244

LLM-Driven SAT Impact on Phishing Defense: A Cross-Sectional Analysis,H. ????,2024 12th International Symposium on Digital Forensics and Security (ISDFS),2024,"Amidst the growing sophistication of phishing threats that exploit human vulnerabilities, this study investigates the effectiveness of Security Awareness Training (SAT) enhanced by Large Language Models (LLMs). Targeting a diverse group of 1,270 participants, including academicians, officers, and students, it aims to evaluate whether LLM-driven SAT can strengthen phishing defenses and cultivate a more resilient digital environment. Initial assessments revealed a baseline Phish Prone Percentage (PPP) of 18.3%, indicating a pronounced vulnerability across participant groups. The deployment of an LLM-enhanced SAT program, characterized by its adaptive and interactive training modules, led to a significant post-training reduction in PPP to 6.3%. This outcome demonstrates the program's success in mitigating phishing risks and underscores the necessity of evolving SAT strategies to combat the dynamic nature of phishing attacks. The study's findings, illustrating a substantial improvement in phishing defense capabilities through LLM-integrated SAT, advocate for the integration of advanced technologies in cybersecurity education. By effectively lowering phishing vulnerability from 18.3% to 6.3%, this research highlights the critical role of innovative training methodologies in enhancing digital security across varied academic and professional landscapes.",10.1109/ISDFS60797.2024.10527274,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10527274

Efficiently Learning an Encoder That Classifies Token Replacements and Masked Permuted Network-Based BIGRU Attention Classifier for Enhancing Sentiment Classification of Scientific Text,M. Inaam Ul Haq; K. Mahmood; Q. Li; A. K. Das; S. Shetty; M. Hussain,IEEE Access,2024,"The exponential growth of scientific literature in digital repositories poses challenges in interpreting complex attitudes within academic texts. Traditional sentiment analysis methods often struggle with nuanced word meanings due to contextual variations. To address this, we propose the Electra-MPNet-based BiGRU attention classifier that extracts the high-level semantic features from citation sentences using the combined strength of Electra and MPNet encoder layers. These features are then combined to extract long-range dependencies through a stacked BiGRU layer. A linear attention mechanism is imposed to estimate the attention weights and context vector which enables the model to selectively focus on relevant information. The proposed model overcomes inherent constraints and adeptly manages contextual information, enhancing the model?€?s understanding of sequential data and improving predictive accuracy. We evaluate the proposed model on a dataset of 8736 citation sentences extracted from scientific articles spanning multiple domains. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models like LSTM-GRU, Bert-BiLSTM, Bert-LSTM-CNN and MPNet, Electra, BiGRU, and machine learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and kappa measure which further solidifies its superiority in scientific text sentiment analysis tasks.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3516946,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10798448
