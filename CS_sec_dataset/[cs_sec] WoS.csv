   cybersecurity for both defensive and offensive strategies. However,
   threat actors also persist in utilizing these technologies to enhance
   the speed, accuracy, and sophistication of their attacks. Hence, it is
   essential to train the next generation of cybersecurity learners not
   only on how to use AI technology but also on how to leverage these
   technologies to enhance the efficiency of their work. This extended
   abstract describes our exploratory work on the use of generative
   AI-based pedagogical approaches in cybersecurity education. This
   extended abstract will describe some preliminary findings on large
   language model-powered pedagogical approaches to cybersecurity education
   and training. These approaches will help cybersecurity educators enhance
   their teaching methods to equip learners with the essential skills

   cybersecurity training, designed to educate users on fundamental
   cybersecurity concepts. This paper focuses on creating an interactive
   system where users can ask questions about computer security and receive
   accurate, informative responses. By addressing cybersecurity as a
   critical national issue, the LLM empowers individuals and organizations
   to defend against malicious cyber threats. Our system was developed
   using Python, utilizing Google Sheets as a database, Gradio for the user
   interface, and Google Gemini's API for advanced language processing. The
   implementation followed a test-driven development approach, iterating
   between coding and testing to ensure functionality and reliability. Key
   technologies include Mistral's Large 2 model and embedding models for
   clustering related data. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   framework was employed to integrate information retrieval with the LLM,
   enhancing its accuracy and relevance. Tools such as Google Suite, Colab,
   and Gradio contributed to creating a robust and user-friendly system.

   education to identify key topics and challenges for examination.
   Secondly, we meticulously assess and compare the efficacy of ChatGPT and
   Gemini across various factors in producing satisfactory responses.
   Lastly, we explore the impact of leveraging prompt engineering on

   This situation can affect the quality of the course's learning outcomes.
   These challenges become more pronounced in today's higher education,
   because of the heightened complexity arising from the need to cover a
   range of course materials, diverse student backgrounds, varying skill
   levels, and different student expectations-all within the constraints of
   a fixed teaching and learning schedule. Furthermore, due to resource
   constraints, not every instructor has the availability of a teaching

   attacks, specifically phishing. This advancement adds to the challenges
   the cybersecurity community is facing, such as lack of motivation to
   change unsafe behaviors and low engagement with awareness raising,
   education and training activities. Often, the problem is attributed to
   the fact that activities communicate the same message across different
   audiences. This approach is not helpful to assist people relating to the
   problem, realizing the threat and how it can be transformed. To build
   cyber resilience against phishing, the workforce needs to realize how
   phishing can be delivered in the context of their working environment
